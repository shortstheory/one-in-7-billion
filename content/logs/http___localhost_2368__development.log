The biggest benefit of Markdown is that you can quickly apply formatting as you type, without needing to pause.</p>\n<p>At the bottom of the editor, you'll find a toolbar with basic formatting options to help you get started as easily as possible. You'll also notice that there's a <strong>?</strong> icon, which contains more advanced shortcuts.</p>\n<p>For now, though, let's run you through some of the basics. You'll want to make sure you're editing this post in order to see all the Markdown we've used.</p>\n<h2 id=\"formattingtext\">Formatting text</h2>\n<p>The most common shortcuts are of course, <strong>bold</strong> text, <em>italic</em> text, and <a href=\"https://example.com\">hyperlinks</a>. These generally make up the bulk of any document. You can type the characters out, but you can also use keyboard shortcuts.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>CMD/Ctrl + B</code> for Bold</li>\n<li><code>CMD/Ctrl + I</code> for Italic</li>\n<li><code>CMD/Ctrl + K</code> for a Link</li>\n<li><code>CMD/Ctrl + H</code> for a Heading (Press multiple times for h2/h3/h4/etc)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With just a couple of extra characters here and there, you're well on your way to creating a beautifully formatted story.</p>\n<h2 id=\"insertingimages\">Inserting images</h2>\n<p>Images in Markdown look just the same as links, except they're prefixed with an exclamation mark, like this:</p>\n<p><code>![Image description](/path/to/image.jpg)</code></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://casper.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/computer.jpg\" alt=\"Computer\"></p>\n<p>Most Markdown editors don't make you type this out, though. In Ghost you can click on the image icon in the toolbar at the bottom of the editor, or you can just click and drag an image from your desktop directly into the editor. Both will upload the image for you and generate the appropriate Markdown.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Important Note:</strong> Ghost does not currently have automatic image resizing, so it's always a good idea to make sure your images aren't gigantic files <strong>before</strong> uploading them to Ghost.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"makinglists\">Making lists</h2>\n<p>Lists in HTML are a formatting nightmare, but in Markdown they become an absolute breeze with just a couple of characters and a bit of smart automation. For numbered lists, just write out the numbers. For bullet lists, just use <code>*</code> or <code>-</code> or <code>+</code>. Like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Crack the eggs over a bowl</li>\n<li>Whisk them together</li>\n<li>Make an omelette</li>\n</ol>\n<p>or</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Remember to buy milk</li>\n<li>Feed the cat</li>\n<li>Come up with idea for next story</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"addingquotes\">Adding quotes</h2>\n<p>When you want to pull out a particularly good excerpt in the middle of a piece, you can use <code>&gt;</code> at the beginning of a paragraph to turn it into a Blockquote. You might've seen this formatting before in email clients.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A well placed quote guides a reader through a story, helping them to understand the most important points being made</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All themes handles blockquotes slightly differently.

You can think of Ghost tags a lot like Gmail labels. By tagging posts with one or more keyword, you can organise articles into buckets of related content.</p>\n<h2 id=\"basictagging\">Basic tagging</h2>\n<p>When you write a post, you can assign tags to help differentiate between categories of content. For example, you might tag some posts with <code>News</code> and other posts with <code>Cycling</code>, which would create two distinct categories of content listed on <code>/tag/news/</code> and <code>/tag/cycling/</code>, respectively.</p>\n<p>If you tag a post with both <code>News</code> <em>and</em> <code>Cycling</code> - then it appears in both sections.</p>\n<p>Tag archives are like dedicated home-pages for each category of content that you have. They have their own pages, their own RSS feeds, and can support their own cover images and meta data.</p>\n<h2 id=\"theprimarytag\">The primary tag</h2>\n<p>Inside the Ghost editor, you can drag and drop tags into a specific order. The first tag in the list is always given the most importance, and some themes will only display the primary tag (the first tag in the list) by default. So you can add the most important tag which you want to show up in your theme, but also add a bunch of related tags which are less important.</p>\n<p><mark><strong>News</strong>, Cycling, Bart Stevens, Extreme Sports</mark></p>\n<p>In this example, <strong>News</strong> is the primary tag which will be displayed by the theme, but the post will also still receive all the other tags, and show up in their respective archives.</p>\n<h2 id=\"privatetags\">Private tags</h2>\n<p>Sometimes you may want to assign a post a specific tag, but you don't necessarily want that tag appearing in the theme or creating an archive page. In Ghost, hashtags are private and can be used for special styling.</p>\n<p>For example, if you sometimes publish posts with video content - you might want your theme to adapt and get rid of the sidebar for these posts, to give more space for an embedded video to fill the screen. In this case, you could use private tags to tell your theme what to do.</p>\n<p><mark><strong>News</strong>, Cycling, #video</mark></p>\n<p>Here, the theme would assign the post publicly displayed tags of <code>News</code>, and <code>Cycling</code> - but it would also keep a private record of the post being tagged with <code>#video</code>.</p>\n<p>In your theme, you could then look for private tags conditionally and give them special formatting:</p>\n<pre><code>{{#post}}\n    {{#has tag=&quot;#video&quot;}}\n        ...markup for a nice big video post layout...\n    {{else}}\n        ...regular markup for a post...\n    {{/has}}\n{{/post}}\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can find documentation for theme development techniques like this and many more over on Ghost's extensive <a href=\"https://themes.ghost.org/v1.23.0/\">theme documentation</a>.</p>\n</div>","feature_image":"https://casper.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/tags.jpg","featured":false,"page":false,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","published_at":{},"published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"authors":{"0":{"id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","name":"Ghost","slug":"ghost","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":"You can delete this user to remove all the welcome posts","website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":null}},"tags":{"0":{"id":"5b71b48007d562588c4a3645","name":"Getting Started","slug":"getting-started","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","parent":null}},"author":{"id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","name":"Ghost","slug":"ghost","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":"You can delete this user to remove all the welcome posts","website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":null},"primary_author":{"id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","name":"Ghost","slug":"ghost","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":"You can delete this user to remove all the welcome posts","website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":null},"primary_tag":{"id":"5b71b48007d562588c4a3645","name":"Getting Started","slug":"getting-started","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","parent":null},"url":"/using-tags/","comment_id":"5b71b48207d562588c4a368f"},"_locals":{"version":"1.25.4","safeVersion":"1.25","relativeUrl":"/using-tags/amp/","secure":false,"client":{"id":"ghost-frontend","secret":"df0a31c219a6"},"context":{"0":"amp","1":"post"}}},"query":{}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"public, max-age=0","content-type":"text/html; charset=utf-8","content-length":"18111","etag":"W/\"46bf-2nYO9Em+j11UKK8yw66OQhm3pJM\"","vary":"Accept-Encoding"},"statusCode":200,"responseTime":"41ms"},"msg":"","time":"2018-08-13T17:00:46.650Z","v":0}

Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, <code>like this</code>. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks:</p>\n<pre><code>.my-link {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using <a href=\"http://prismjs.com/\">Prism.js</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fullbleedimages\">Full bleed images</h2>\n<p>One neat trick which you can use in Markdown to distinguish between different types of images is to add a <code>#hash</code> value to the end of the source URL, and then target images containing the hash with special styling. For example:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://casper.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/walking.jpg#full\" alt=\"walking\"></p>\n<p>which is styled with...</p>\n<pre><code>img[src$=&quot;#full&quot;] {\n    max-width: 100vw;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This creates full-bleed images in the Casper theme, which stretch beyond their usual boundaries right up to the edge of the window. Every theme handles these types of things slightly differently, but it's a great trick to play with if you want to have a variety of image sizes and styles.</p>\n<h2 id=\"referencelists\">Reference lists</h2>\n<p><strong>The quick brown <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox\" title=\"Wikipedia: Fox\">fox</a>, jumped over the lazy <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog\" title=\"Wikipedia: Dog\">dog</a>.</strong></p>\n<p>Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference.</p>\n<h2 id=\"creatingfootnotes\">Creating footnotes</h2>\n<p>The quick brown fox<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\">[1]</a></sup> jumped over the lazy dog<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\">[2]</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>Footnotes are a great way to add additional contextual details when appropriate. Ghost will automatically add footnote content to the very end of your post.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fullhtml\">Full HTML</h2>\n<p>Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you're never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Ghost editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits!

However, Ghost can also be completely themed to suit your needs. Rather than just giving you a few basic settings which act as a poor proxy for code, we just let you write code.</p>\n<p>There are a huge range of both free and premium pre-built themes which you can get from the <a href=\"http://marketplace.ghost.org\">Ghost Theme Marketplace</a>, or you can simply create your own from scratch.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://marketplace.ghost.org\"><img src=\"https://casper.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/marketplace.jpg\" alt=\"marketplace\"></a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Anyone can write a completely custom Ghost theme, with just some solid knowledge of HTML and CSS</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ghost themes are written with a templating language called handlebars, which has a bunch of dynamic helpers to insert your data into template files. Like <code>{{author.name}}</code>, for example, outputs the name of the current author.</p>\n<p>The best way to learn how to write your own Ghost theme is to have a look at <a href=\"https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper\">the source code for Casper</a>, which is heavily commented and should give you a sense of how everything fits together.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>default.hbs</code> is the main template file, all contexts will load inside this file unless specifically told to use a different template.</li>\n<li><code>post.hbs</code> is the file used in the context of viewing a post.</li>\n<li><code>index.hbs</code> is the file used in the context of viewing the home page.</li>\n<li>and so on</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We've got <a href=\"http://themes.ghost.org/v1.23.0/docs/about\">full and extensive theme documentation</a> which outlines every template file, context and helper that you can use.</p>\n<p>If you want to chat with other people making Ghost themes to get any advice or help, there's also a <strong>themes</strong> section on our <a href=\"https://forum.ghost.org/c/themes\">public Ghost forum</a>.</p>\n</div>","feature_image":"https://casper.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/design.jpg","featured":false,"page":false,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","published_at":{},"published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"authors":{"0":{"id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","name":"Ghost","slug":"ghost","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":"You can delete this user to remove all the welcome posts","website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":null}},"tags":{"0":{"id":"5b71b48007d562588c4a3645","name":"Getting Started","slug":"getting-started","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","parent":null}},"author":{"id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","name":"Ghost","slug":"ghost","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":"You can delete this user to remove all the welcome posts","website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":null},"primary_author":{"id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","name":"Ghost","slug":"ghost","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":"You can delete this user to remove all the welcome posts","website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":null},"primary_tag":{"id":"5b71b48007d562588c4a3645","name":"Getting Started","slug":"getting-started","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","parent":null},"url":"/themes/","comment_id":"5b71b48207d562588c4a3687"},"_locals":{"version":"1.25.4","safeVersion":"1.25","relativeUrl":"/themes/amp/","secure":false,"client":{"id":"ghost-frontend","secret":"df0a31c219a6"},"context":{"0":"amp","1":"post"}}},"query":{}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"public, max-age=0","content-type":"text/html; charset=utf-8","content-length":"17273","etag":"W/\"4379-sqEazVccM14W/uUcuf8SiUGyR7M\"","vary":"Accept-Encoding"},"statusCode":200,"responseTime":"1105ms"},"msg":"","time":"2018-08-13T17:00:49.547Z","v":0}

The biggest benefit of Markdown is that you can quickly apply formatting as you type, without needing to pause.</p>\n<p>At the bottom of the editor, you'll find a toolbar with basic formatting options to help you get started as easily as possible. You'll also notice that there's a <strong>?</strong> icon, which contains more advanced shortcuts.</p>\n<p>For now, though, let's run you through some of the basics. You'll want to make sure you're editing this post in order to see all the Markdown we've used.</p>\n<h2 id=\"formattingtext\">Formatting text</h2>\n<p>The most common shortcuts are of course, <strong>bold</strong> text, <em>italic</em> text, and <a href=\"https://example.com\">hyperlinks</a>. These generally make up the bulk of any document. You can type the characters out, but you can also use keyboard shortcuts.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>CMD/Ctrl + B</code> for Bold</li>\n<li><code>CMD/Ctrl + I</code> for Italic</li>\n<li><code>CMD/Ctrl + K</code> for a Link</li>\n<li><code>CMD/Ctrl + H</code> for a Heading (Press multiple times for h2/h3/h4/etc)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With just a couple of extra characters here and there, you're well on your way to creating a beautifully formatted story.</p>\n<h2 id=\"insertingimages\">Inserting images</h2>\n<p>Images in Markdown look just the same as links, except they're prefixed with an exclamation mark, like this:</p>\n<p><code>![Image description](/path/to/image.jpg)</code></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://casper.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/computer.jpg\" alt=\"Computer\"></p>\n<p>Most Markdown editors don't make you type this out, though. In Ghost you can click on the image icon in the toolbar at the bottom of the editor, or you can just click and drag an image from your desktop directly into the editor. Both will upload the image for you and generate the appropriate Markdown.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Important Note:</strong> Ghost does not currently have automatic image resizing, so it's always a good idea to make sure your images aren't gigantic files <strong>before</strong> uploading them to Ghost.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"makinglists\">Making lists</h2>\n<p>Lists in HTML are a formatting nightmare, but in Markdown they become an absolute breeze with just a couple of characters and a bit of smart automation. For numbered lists, just write out the numbers. For bullet lists, just use <code>*</code> or <code>-</code> or <code>+</code>. Like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Crack the eggs over a bowl</li>\n<li>Whisk them together</li>\n<li>Make an omelette</li>\n</ol>\n<p>or</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Remember to buy milk</li>\n<li>Feed the cat</li>\n<li>Come up with idea for next story</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"addingquotes\">Adding quotes</h2>\n<p>When you want to pull out a particularly good excerpt in the middle of a piece, you can use <code>&gt;</code> at the beginning of a paragraph to turn it into a Blockquote. You might've seen this formatting before in email clients.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A well placed quote guides a reader through a story, helping them to understand the most important points being made</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All themes handles blockquotes slightly differently. Sometimes they'll look better kept shorter, while other times you can quote fairly hefty amounts of text and get away with it. Generally, the safest option is to use blockquotes sparingly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dividingthingsup\">Dividing things up</h2>\n<p>If you're writing a piece in parts and you just feel like you need to divide a couple of sections distinctly from each other, a horizontal rule might be just what you need. Dropping <code>---</code> on a new line will create a sleek divider, anywhere you want it.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>This should get you going with the vast majority of what you need to do in the editor, but if you're still curious about more advanced tips then check out the <a href=\"/advanced-markdown/\">Advanced Markdown Guide</a> - or if you'd rather learn about how Ghost taxononomies work, we've got a overview of <a href=\"/using-tags/\">how to use Ghost tags</a>.</p>\n</div>","feature_image":"https://casper.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/writing.jpg","featured":false,"page":false,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","published_at":{},"published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"authors":{"0":{"id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","name":"Ghost","slug":"ghost","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":"You can delete this user to remove all the welcome posts","website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":null}},"tags":{"0":{"id":"5b71b48007d562588c4a3645","name":"Getting Started","slug":"getting-started","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","parent":null}},"author":{"id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","name":"Ghost","slug":"ghost","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":"You can delete this user to remove all the welcome posts","website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":null},"primary_author":{"id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","name":"Ghost","slug":"ghost","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":"You can delete this user to remove all the welcome posts","website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":null},"primary_tag":{"id":"5b71b48007d562588c4a3645","name":"Getting Started","slug":"getting-started","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","parent":null},"url":"/the-editor/","comment_id":"5b71b48207d562588c4a3691"},"_locals":{"version":"1.25.4","safeVersion":"1.25","relativeUrl":"/the-editor/amp/","secure":false,"client":{"id":"ghost-frontend","secret":"df0a31c219a6"},"context":{"0":"amp","1":"post"}}},"query":{}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"public, max-age=0","content-type":"text/html; charset=utf-8","content-length":"19315","etag":"W/\"4b73-Goc8xc3DaiRvIQJSSm/iXgnxEMY\"","vary":"Accept-Encoding"},"statusCode":200,"responseTime":"36ms"},"msg":"","time":"2018-08-13T17:10:01.157Z","v":0}

You can think of Ghost tags a lot like Gmail labels. By tagging posts with one or more keyword, you can organise articles into buckets of related content.</p>\n<h2 id=\"basictagging\">Basic tagging</h2>\n<p>When you write a post, you can assign tags to help differentiate between categories of content. For example, you might tag some posts with <code>News</code> and other posts with <code>Cycling</code>, which would create two distinct categories of content listed on <code>/tag/news/</code> and <code>/tag/cycling/</code>, respectively.</p>\n<p>If you tag a post with both <code>News</code> <em>and</em> <code>Cycling</code> - then it appears in both sections.</p>\n<p>Tag archives are like dedicated home-pages for each category of content that you have. They have their own pages, their own RSS feeds, and can support their own cover images and meta data.</p>\n<h2 id=\"theprimarytag\">The primary tag</h2>\n<p>Inside the Ghost editor, you can drag and drop tags into a specific order. The first tag in the list is always given the most importance, and some themes will only display the primary tag (the first tag in the list) by default. So you can add the most important tag which you want to show up in your theme, but also add a bunch of related tags which are less important.</p>\n<p><mark><strong>News</strong>, Cycling, Bart Stevens, Extreme Sports</mark></p>\n<p>In this example, <strong>News</strong> is the primary tag which will be displayed by the theme, but the post will also still receive all the other tags, and show up in their respective archives.</p>\n<h2 id=\"privatetags\">Private tags</h2>\n<p>Sometimes you may want to assign a post a specific tag, but you don't necessarily want that tag appearing in the theme or creating an archive page. In Ghost, hashtags are private and can be used for special styling.</p>\n<p>For example, if you sometimes publish posts with video content - you might want your theme to adapt and get rid of the sidebar for these posts, to give more space for an embedded video to fill the screen. In this case, you could use private tags to tell your theme what to do.</p>\n<p><mark><strong>News</strong>, Cycling, #video</mark></p>\n<p>Here, the theme would assign the post publicly displayed tags of <code>News</code>, and <code>Cycling</code> - but it would also keep a private record of the post being tagged with <code>#video</code>.</p>\n<p>In your theme, you could then look for private tags conditionally and give them special formatting:</p>\n<pre><code>{{#post}}\n    {{#has tag=&quot;#video&quot;}}\n        ...markup for a nice big video post layout...\n    {{else}}\n        ...regular markup for a post...\n    {{/has}}\n{{/post}}\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can find documentation for theme development techniques like this and many more over on Ghost's extensive <a href=\"https://themes.ghost.org/v1.23.0/\">theme documentation</a>.</p>\n</div>","feature_image":"https://casper.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/tags.jpg","featured":false,"page":false,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","published_at":{},"published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"authors":{"0":{"id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","name":"Ghost","slug":"ghost","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":"You can delete this user to remove all the welcome posts","website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":null}},"tags":{"0":{"id":"5b71b48007d562588c4a3645","name":"Getting Started","slug":"getting-started","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","parent":null}},"author":{"id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","name":"Ghost","slug":"ghost","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":"You can delete this user to remove all the welcome posts","website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":null},"primary_author":{"id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","name":"Ghost","slug":"ghost","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":"You can delete this user to remove all the welcome posts","website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":null},"primary_tag":{"id":"5b71b48007d562588c4a3645","name":"Getting Started","slug":"getting-started","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","parent":null},"url":"/using-tags/","comment_id":"5b71b48207d562588c4a368f"},"_locals":{"version":"1.25.4","safeVersion":"1.25","relativeUrl":"/using-tags/amp/","secure":false,"client":{"id":"ghost-frontend","secret":"df0a31c219a6"},"context":{"0":"amp","1":"post"}}},"query":{}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"public, max-age=0","content-type":"text/html; charset=utf-8","content-length":"18111","etag":"W/\"46bf-2nYO9Em+j11UKK8yw66OQhm3pJM\"","vary":"Accept-Encoding"},"statusCode":200,"responseTime":"103ms"},"msg":"","time":"2018-08-13T17:10:01.263Z","v":0}

Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, <code>like this</code>. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks:</p>\n<pre><code>.my-link {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using <a href=\"http://prismjs.com/\">Prism.js</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fullbleedimages\">Full bleed images</h2>\n<p>One neat trick which you can use in Markdown to distinguish between different types of images is to add a <code>#hash</code> value to the end of the source URL, and then target images containing the hash with special styling. For example:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://casper.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/walking.jpg#full\" alt=\"walking\"></p>\n<p>which is styled with...</p>\n<pre><code>img[src$=&quot;#full&quot;] {\n    max-width: 100vw;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This creates full-bleed images in the Casper theme, which stretch beyond their usual boundaries right up to the edge of the window. Every theme handles these types of things slightly differently, but it's a great trick to play with if you want to have a variety of image sizes and styles.</p>\n<h2 id=\"referencelists\">Reference lists</h2>\n<p><strong>The quick brown <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox\" title=\"Wikipedia: Fox\">fox</a>, jumped over the lazy <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog\" title=\"Wikipedia: Dog\">dog</a>.</strong></p>\n<p>Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference.</p>\n<h2 id=\"creatingfootnotes\">Creating footnotes</h2>\n<p>The quick brown fox<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\">[1]</a></sup> jumped over the lazy dog<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\">[2]</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>Footnotes are a great way to add additional contextual details when appropriate. Ghost will automatically add footnote content to the very end of your post.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fullhtml\">Full HTML</h2>\n<p>Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you're never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Ghost editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits!

The biggest benefit of Markdown is that you can quickly apply formatting as you type, without needing to pause.</p>\n<p>At the bottom of the editor, you'll find a toolbar with basic formatting options to help you get started as easily as possible. You'll also notice that there's a <strong>?</strong> icon, which contains more advanced shortcuts.</p>\n<p>For now, though, let's run you through some of the basics. You'll want to make sure you're editing this post in order to see all the Markdown we've used.</p>\n<h2 id=\"formattingtext\">Formatting text</h2>\n<p>The most common shortcuts are of course, <strong>bold</strong> text, <em>italic</em> text, and <a href=\"https://example.com\">hyperlinks</a>. These generally make up the bulk of any document. You can type the characters out, but you can also use keyboard shortcuts.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>CMD/Ctrl + B</code> for Bold</li>\n<li><code>CMD/Ctrl + I</code> for Italic</li>\n<li><code>CMD/Ctrl + K</code> for a Link</li>\n<li><code>CMD/Ctrl + H</code> for a Heading (Press multiple times for h2/h3/h4/etc)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With just a couple of extra characters here and there, you're well on your way to creating a beautifully formatted story.</p>\n<h2 id=\"insertingimages\">Inserting images</h2>\n<p>Images in Markdown look just the same as links, except they're prefixed with an exclamation mark, like this:</p>\n<p><code>![Image description](/path/to/image.jpg)</code></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://casper.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/computer.jpg\" alt=\"Computer\"></p>\n<p>Most Markdown editors don't make you type this out, though. In Ghost you can click on the image icon in the toolbar at the bottom of the editor, or you can just click and drag an image from your desktop directly into the editor. Both will upload the image for you and generate the appropriate Markdown.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Important Note:</strong> Ghost does not currently have automatic image resizing, so it's always a good idea to make sure your images aren't gigantic files <strong>before</strong> uploading them to Ghost.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"makinglists\">Making lists</h2>\n<p>Lists in HTML are a formatting nightmare, but in Markdown they become an absolute breeze with just a couple of characters and a bit of smart automation. For numbered lists, just write out the numbers. For bullet lists, just use <code>*</code> or <code>-</code> or <code>+</code>. Like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Crack the eggs over a bowl</li>\n<li>Whisk them together</li>\n<li>Make an omelette</li>\n</ol>\n<p>or</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Remember to buy milk</li>\n<li>Feed the cat</li>\n<li>Come up with idea for next story</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"addingquotes\">Adding quotes</h2>\n<p>When you want to pull out a particularly good excerpt in the middle of a piece, you can use <code>&gt;</code> at the beginning of a paragraph to turn it into a Blockquote. You might've seen this formatting before in email clients.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A well placed quote guides a reader through a story, helping them to understand the most important points being made</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All themes handles blockquotes slightly differently. Sometimes they'll look better kept shorter, while other times you can quote fairly hefty amounts of text and get away with it. Generally, the safest option is to use blockquotes sparingly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dividingthingsup\">Dividing things up</h2>\n<p>If you're writing a piece in parts and you just feel like you need to divide a couple of sections distinctly from each other, a horizontal rule might be just what you need. Dropping <code>---</code> on a new line will create a sleek divider, anywhere you want it.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>This should get you going with the vast majority of what you need to do in the editor, but if you're still curious about more advanced tips then check out the <a href=\"/advanced-markdown/\">Advanced Markdown Guide</a> - or if you'd rather learn about how Ghost taxononomies work, we've got a overview of <a href=\"/using-tags/\">how to use Ghost tags</a>.</p>\n</div>","feature_image":"https://casper.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/writing.jpg","featured":false,"page":false,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","published_at":{},"published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"authors":{"0":{"id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","name":"Ghost","slug":"ghost","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":"You can delete this user to remove all the welcome posts","website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":null}},"tags":{"0":{"id":"5b71b48007d562588c4a3645","name":"Getting Started","slug":"getting-started","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","parent":null}},"author":{"id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","name":"Ghost","slug":"ghost","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":"You can delete this user to remove all the welcome posts","website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":null},"primary_author":{"id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","name":"Ghost","slug":"ghost","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":"You can delete this user to remove all the welcome posts","website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":null},"primary_tag":{"id":"5b71b48007d562588c4a3645","name":"Getting Started","slug":"getting-started","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","parent":null},"url":"/the-editor/","comment_id":"5b71b48207d562588c4a3691"},"_locals":{"version":"1.25.4","safeVersion":"1.25","relativeUrl":"/the-editor/amp/","secure":false,"client":{"id":"ghost-frontend","secret":"df0a31c219a6"},"context":{"0":"amp","1":"post"}}},"query":{}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"public, max-age=0","content-type":"text/html; charset=utf-8","content-length":"19315","etag":"W/\"4b73-Goc8xc3DaiRvIQJSSm/iXgnxEMY\"","vary":"Accept-Encoding"},"statusCode":200,"responseTime":"29ms"},"msg":"","time":"2018-08-13T17:13:53.543Z","v":0}

You can think of Ghost tags a lot like Gmail labels. By tagging posts with one or more keyword, you can organise articles into buckets of related content.</p>\n<h2 id=\"basictagging\">Basic tagging</h2>\n<p>When you write a post, you can assign tags to help differentiate between categories of content. For example, you might tag some posts with <code>News</code> and other posts with <code>Cycling</code>, which would create two distinct categories of content listed on <code>/tag/news/</code> and <code>/tag/cycling/</code>, respectively.</p>\n<p>If you tag a post with both <code>News</code> <em>and</em> <code>Cycling</code> - then it appears in both sections.</p>\n<p>Tag archives are like dedicated home-pages for each category of content that you have. They have their own pages, their own RSS feeds, and can support their own cover images and meta data.</p>\n<h2 id=\"theprimarytag\">The primary tag</h2>\n<p>Inside the Ghost editor, you can drag and drop tags into a specific order. The first tag in the list is always given the most importance, and some themes will only display the primary tag (the first tag in the list) by default. So you can add the most important tag which you want to show up in your theme, but also add a bunch of related tags which are less important.</p>\n<p><mark><strong>News</strong>, Cycling, Bart Stevens, Extreme Sports</mark></p>\n<p>In this example, <strong>News</strong> is the primary tag which will be displayed by the theme, but the post will also still receive all the other tags, and show up in their respective archives.</p>\n<h2 id=\"privatetags\">Private tags</h2>\n<p>Sometimes you may want to assign a post a specific tag, but you don't necessarily want that tag appearing in the theme or creating an archive page. In Ghost, hashtags are private and can be used for special styling.</p>\n<p>For example, if you sometimes publish posts with video content - you might want your theme to adapt and get rid of the sidebar for these posts, to give more space for an embedded video to fill the screen. In this case, you could use private tags to tell your theme what to do.</p>\n<p><mark><strong>News</strong>, Cycling, #video</mark></p>\n<p>Here, the theme would assign the post publicly displayed tags of <code>News</code>, and <code>Cycling</code> - but it would also keep a private record of the post being tagged with <code>#video</code>.</p>\n<p>In your theme, you could then look for private tags conditionally and give them special formatting:</p>\n<pre><code>{{#post}}\n    {{#has tag=&quot;#video&quot;}}\n        ...markup for a nice big video post layout...\n    {{else}}\n        ...regular markup for a post...\n    {{/has}}\n{{/post}}\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can find documentation for theme development techniques like this and many more over on Ghost's extensive <a href=\"https://themes.ghost.org/v1.23.0/\">theme documentation</a>.</p>\n</div>","feature_image":"https://casper.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/tags.jpg","featured":false,"page":false,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","published_at":{},"published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"authors":{"0":{"id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","name":"Ghost","slug":"ghost","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":"You can delete this user to remove all the welcome posts","website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":null}},"tags":{"0":{"id":"5b71b48007d562588c4a3645","name":"Getting Started","slug":"getting-started","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","parent":null}},"author":{"id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","name":"Ghost","slug":"ghost","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":"You can delete this user to remove all the welcome posts","website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":null},"primary_author":{"id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","name":"Ghost","slug":"ghost","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":"You can delete this user to remove all the welcome posts","website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":null},"primary_tag":{"id":"5b71b48007d562588c4a3645","name":"Getting Started","slug":"getting-started","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","parent":null},"url":"/using-tags/","comment_id":"5b71b48207d562588c4a368f"},"_locals":{"version":"1.25.4","safeVersion":"1.25","relativeUrl":"/using-tags/amp/","secure":false,"client":{"id":"ghost-frontend","secret":"df0a31c219a6"},"context":{"0":"amp","1":"post"}}},"query":{}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"public, max-age=0","content-type":"text/html; charset=utf-8","content-length":"18111","etag":"W/\"46bf-2nYO9Em+j11UKK8yw66OQhm3pJM\"","vary":"Accept-Encoding"},"statusCode":200,"responseTime":"30ms"},"msg":"","time":"2018-08-13T17:13:53.575Z","v":0}

Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, <code>like this</code>. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks:</p>\n<pre><code>.my-link {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using <a href=\"http://prismjs.com/\">Prism.js</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fullbleedimages\">Full bleed images</h2>\n<p>One neat trick which you can use in Markdown to distinguish between different types of images is to add a <code>#hash</code> value to the end of the source URL, and then target images containing the hash with special styling. For example:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://casper.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/walking.jpg#full\" alt=\"walking\"></p>\n<p>which is styled with...</p>\n<pre><code>img[src$=&quot;#full&quot;] {\n    max-width: 100vw;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This creates full-bleed images in the Casper theme, which stretch beyond their usual boundaries right up to the edge of the window. Every theme handles these types of things slightly differently, but it's a great trick to play with if you want to have a variety of image sizes and styles.</p>\n<h2 id=\"referencelists\">Reference lists</h2>\n<p><strong>The quick brown <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox\" title=\"Wikipedia: Fox\">fox</a>, jumped over the lazy <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog\" title=\"Wikipedia: Dog\">dog</a>.</strong></p>\n<p>Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference.</p>\n<h2 id=\"creatingfootnotes\">Creating footnotes</h2>\n<p>The quick brown fox<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\">[1]</a></sup> jumped over the lazy dog<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\">[2]</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>Footnotes are a great way to add additional contextual details when appropriate. Ghost will automatically add footnote content to the very end of your post.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fullhtml\">Full HTML</h2>\n<p>Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you're never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Ghost editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits! Here's a standard YouTube embed code as an example:</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cniqsc9QfDo?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\">\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Foxes are red <a href=\"#fnref1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Dogs are usually not red <a href=\"#fnref2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>\n</div>","feature_image":"https://casper.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/advanced.jpg","featured":false,"page":false,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","published_at":{},"published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"authors":{"0":{"id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","name":"Ghost","slug":"ghost","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":"You can delete this user to remove all the welcome posts","website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":null}},"tags":{"0":{"id":"5b71b48007d562588c4a3645","name":"Getting Started","slug":"getting-started","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","parent":null}},"author":{"id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","name":"Ghost","slug":"ghost","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":"You can delete this user to remove all the welcome posts","website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":null},"primary_author":{"id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","name":"Ghost","slug":"ghost","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":"You can delete this user to remove all the welcome posts","website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":null},"primary_tag":{"id":"5b71b48007d562588c4a3645","name":"Getting Started","slug":"getting-started","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","parent":null},"url":"/advanced-markdown/","comment_id":"5b71b48207d562588c4a3689"},"_locals":{"version":"1.25.4","safeVersion":"1.25","relativeUrl":"/advanced-markdown/amp/","secure":false,"client":{"id":"ghost-frontend","secret":"df0a31c219a6"},"context":{"0":"amp","1":"post"}}},"query":{}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"public, max-age=0","content-type":"text/html; charset=utf-8","content-length":"19029","etag":"W/\"4a55-L6mnb0fLkCH6ui2dbFccFtrpvgQ\"","vary":"Accept-Encoding"},"statusCode":200,"responseTime":"34ms"},"msg":"","time":"2018-08-13T17:13:53.667Z","v":0}

Like <code>{{author.name}}</code>, for example, outputs the name of the current author.</p>\n<p>The best way to learn how to write your own Ghost theme is to have a look at <a href=\"https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper\">the source code for Casper</a>, which is heavily commented and should give you a sense of how everything fits together.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>default.hbs</code> is the main template file, all contexts will load inside this file unless specifically told to use a different template.</li>\n<li><code>post.hbs</code> is the file used in the context of viewing a post.</li>\n<li><code>index.hbs</code> is the file used in the context of viewing the home page.</li>\n<li>and so on</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We've got <a href=\"http://themes.ghost.org/v1.23.0/docs/about\">full and extensive theme documentation</a> which outlines every template file, context and helper that you can use.</p>\n<p>If you want to chat with other people making Ghost themes to get any advice or help, there's also a <strong>themes</strong> section on our <a href=\"https://forum.ghost.org/c/themes\">public Ghost forum</a>.</p>\n</div>","feature_image":"https://casper.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/design.jpg","featured":false,"page":false,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","published_at":{},"published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"authors":{"0":{"id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","name":"Ghost","slug":"ghost","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":"You can delete this user to remove all the welcome posts","website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":null}},"tags":{"0":{"id":"5b71b48007d562588c4a3645","name":"Getting Started","slug":"getting-started","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","parent":null}},"author":{"id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","name":"Ghost","slug":"ghost","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":"You can delete this user to remove all the welcome posts","website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":null},"primary_author":{"id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","name":"Ghost","slug":"ghost","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":"You can delete this user to remove all the welcome posts","website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":null,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":null},"primary_tag":{"id":"5b71b48007d562588c4a3645","name":"Getting Started","slug":"getting-started","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","parent":null},"url":"/themes/","comment_id":"5b71b48207d562588c4a3687"},"_locals":{"version":"1.25.4","safeVersion":"1.25","relativeUrl":"/themes/amp/","secure":false,"client":{"id":"ghost-frontend","secret":"df0a31c219a6"},"context":{"0":"amp","1":"post"}}},"query":{}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"public, max-age=0","content-type":"text/html; charset=utf-8","content-length":"17273","etag":"W/\"4379-sqEazVccM14W/uUcuf8SiUGyR7M\"","vary":"Accept-Encoding"},"statusCode":200,"responseTime":"26ms"},"msg":"","time":"2018-08-13T17:13:53.695Z","v":0}

Viewing from not an expert's position, not from a parent's position, not from a teacher's position, but from a high school, bored student's perspective, this post is just a rant about our muddled education system.\\n\\n**CCE**: This was supposed to be the next big thing to do away with exams. However, the government's magic wand failed to do much on these counts, and instead of doing away with exams, it succeeded to give us a cornucopia of projects and assignments, to keep us busy in our already syncopated free time. It probably could've done a lot more if they had revised their assessment, but.....\\n\\n**Emphasis on exams**: What the education board has largely taught the majority of Indian students is that failure in exams is tantamount to failure in life. It screams to say that exams are the most important thing that could have happened since the Big Bang, and that failing could just as well result in the destruction of the universe itself. It would be an understatement to say that \\\"10th graders in India suicide\\\", because the existence threatening virus has got to almost all age groups. For the sake of lives, try to change these stereotypes, CBSE.\\n\\n**Lack of thinking problems**: OK, I know what my fellow students are thinking on these counts in math (no pun intended), but problems like these are reserved for \\\"higher classes\\\". It's like slowly walking on a long path and then being forced to run a marathon. Yeah, these problems can't be left out early for the benefit of the \\\"average student\\\". Sure, it is tough going early, but it will pay off in the end. The bar of the \\\"average student\\\" needs to be raised a notch higher on the metaphoric ladder.\\n\\nIf you want more evidence, just look at India's IMO (International Mathematics Olympiad) rating of 72nd out of 73 countries. An average South Korea's 3rd grader is astonishingly  just as good as an average Indian 8th grader at mathematical/mental ability.\\n\\n**Hindi**: As if the subject wasn't terrifying enough, some wise guy decided to give kids 15 chapters of boredom and then ask arbitrary questions in exams. With themes ranging from dirt, mud and random biographies, the Hindi syllabus clearly wasn't reviewed by a person brought up in a ubiquitous English community. If CBSE can reduce the bar so nonchalantly for sciences, why was this treatment skipped for Hindi?\\n\\n**Uniformed board**: This probably saves a lot of confusion, but it means that it needs to cater to all types of society for what the board considers \\\"relevant\\\". Things like forestry and agriculture are hardly needed in urban areas, but then again, this is according to me, not them.\\n\\n**Policies**: Read plural of policy and not law enforcing officers. RTE plans to give education to everyone, which sounds like a nice idea, but in reality is far-fetched. With most 3rd graders failing to pass basic English reading tests (94% to be exact), something seems to be wrong. Even if they somehow do get everyone educated, not everyone can get a job in this country, leaving lots of wasted talent.\\n\\nOn a more positive note, literacy rates have jumped by over 12% since 2001's census. Great news, but these shortcomings give one some food for thought.\\n\\nComment, criticise and praise at your own will.\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","page":false,"published_at":"2012-02-03T10:10:00.000Z","slug":"rantings-indian-education","status":"published","title":"Rantings: Indian Education","updated_at":"2018-08-13T18:17:02.000Z","authors":{"0":{"id":"1","name":"arnav dhamija","slug":"arnav","email":"arnav.dhamija@gmail.com","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"accessibility":"{\"nightShift\":true}","status":"active","locale":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"last_seen":{},"created_at":{},"updated_at":{},"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\",\"upload-a-theme\",\"using-the-editor\"]"}},"tags":{"0":{"id":"5b71c839dd62db5a3cfa0363","name":"Rants","slug":"rants","description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","created_at":{},"updated_at":{},"parent_id":null}}}}},"query":{"include":"authors,tags,authors.roles"}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"no-cache, private, no-store, must-revalidate, max-stale=0, post-check=0, pre-check=0","x-cache-invalidate":"/*","content-type":"application/json; charset=utf-8","etag":"W/\"19a8-in11xOah6k37GelSQ5VysSS3J2M\"","vary":"Accept-Encoding","content-encoding":"gzip"},"statusCode":200,"responseTime":"160ms"},"msg":"","time":"2018-08-13T18:25:34.072Z","v":0}

According to me population growth is _not_ a good trend and achieving it has some serious implications. The world is already ridden with poverty, AIDS and a host of problems with which the majority of the population can not keep up with. Sure, we have more people and man-force. But that doesn't help the fact that unlike population, resources do not reproduce by themselves.

The old collection can be found [here.](/2011/10/19/photography-volume-1/)  \\n\\nNote: not all my photos here are \\\"new, new\\\" photos. Some of them are exceptional shots I took before publishing my last post, but I didn't want to post two pics of the same thing.  \\n\\nMoving on....(click to enlarge)  \\n\\n\\n![IMG_5317](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_5317.JPG)\\n\\n\\nA really neat pose of that squirrel. I didn't expect the sunlight and the ground to merge so well together.  \\n\\n\\n![IMG_5391](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_5391.JPG)\\n\\n\\nLooks like it's been pulled out of a rainforest. The truth is, i found these little birds in my backyard. I love the way the birds sit linearly, almost like a family picture.  \\n\\n\\n![IMG_5575](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_5575.JPG)\\n\\n\\nThis was a bit of an experiment, with very impressive results. Shot it under low lighting with flash at a certain angle, so you can see all the layers of petals in the flower.  \\n\\n\\n![IMG_5696](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_5696.JPG)\\n\\n\\nSlimy snail; and although the picture doesn't exhibit too many photography techniques, it looks pretty decent.  \\n\\n\\n![IMG_5935](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_5935.JPG)\\n\\n\\nThe grasshopper/mantis (I'm no entomologist) strikes an excellent pose for this photo. The raised forearms and the spread out legs give it a great stance.  \\n\\n\\n![IMG_6043](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_6043.JPG)\\n\\n\\nA really simple pic, but that's what makes it look detailed and elegant.  \\n\\n\\n![IMG_6066](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_6066.JPG)\\n\\n\\nCute little birdie. That sounds really stupid. Anyway, I like the perching position of the bird, and the contrast of its black head to its yellow body (sorry if that sounds racist). Birds and insects seem to love posing for me.  \\n\\n\\n![IMG_6149](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_6149.JPG)\\n\\n\\nWow, this picture was an absolute stunner for me. I heard the cat screeching in pain before I found it (probably \\\"cat\\\"fighting). The way its body is silhouetted and the light gleaming off the feline's eyes make it an amazing and thoughtful picture.  \\n\\n\\n![IMG_6164](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_6164.JPG)\\n\\n\\nKind of a filler pic. The flower looks pretty, and I can't say much about this.  \\n\\n\\n![IMG_5639](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_5639.JPG)\\n\\n\\nPerfect pose + perfect clarity + cool insect = awesomeness. The macro worked exceptionally well here.  \\n\\n\\n![IMG_6177](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_6177.JPG)\\n\\n\\nAn example of good timing, this picture was taken early in the morning. The bees seemed to be rising with me and the sharpness in front and the blurred out background, make it another sweet shot.  \\n\\n\\n![IMG_6199](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_6199.JPG)\\n\\n\\nI don't have enough words to describe how much I love this one. At a first glance, you might not see much, but look at the thing looming over the moth's (yes it is a moth) body. Do you count four legs a side? Yup, a spider was ingesting its prey in this one, and seeing it in real life was eerie. Although I can't bring out all the life or death in this photo, I hope you get the message.  \\n\\nI know you'll enjoy these photos, no need to hope.  \\n\\nComment, criticize and praise as you wish.\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","page":false,"published_at":"2012-03-20T09:54:00.000Z","slug":"photography-volume-2","status":"published","title":"Photography: Volume 2","updated_at":"2018-08-13T18:24:58.000Z","authors":{"0":{"id":"1","name":"arnav dhamija","slug":"arnav","email":"arnav.dhamija@gmail.com","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"accessibility":"{\"nightShift\":true}","status":"active","locale":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"last_seen":{},"created_at":{},"updated_at":{},"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\",\"upload-a-theme\",\"using-the-editor\"]"}},"tags":{"0":{"id":"5b71c9a6dd62db5a3cfa0368","name":"Photography","slug":"photography","description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","created_at":{},"updated_at":{},"parent_id":null}}}}},"query":{"include":"authors,tags,authors.roles"}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"no-cache, private, no-store, must-revalidate, max-stale=0, post-check=0, pre-check=0","x-cache-invalidate":"/*","content-type":"application/json; charset=utf-8","etag":"W/\"1a30-FwmlfwWbcSOjYVlmiiOcIIdd6ow\"","vary":"Accept-Encoding","content-encoding":"gzip"},"statusCode":200,"responseTime":"188ms"},"msg":"","time":"2018-08-13T18:27:00.923Z","v":0}

It's not about time (or the lack of it), it's just laziness. Well, a lot of stuff has happened this month (and a lot of pics have been taken), which I simply can't do justice to by putting it in words.  \\n\\nI suppose, I've found a new love as well, some people are going to hate this...  \\n\\n\\n![]({filename}/images/Pokemon-PNG-Pic.png)\\n\\n\\n...well actually it's not a new love, this dates back to 2004, so I'll narrate my history with this incredible video-game.  \\n\\nBack in 2004 when I was only 6 years-old, I was everything one could describe as a Pokemon fan. I used to watch the anime a lot, watched all the released movies, and even had Pokemon drawing and colouring books. In 2005, I was introduced to the world of Pokemon video-games, which I never knew existed. I remember how popular Pokemon used to be in my apartment complex, it was as if a GameBoy Advance and a Pokemon cartridge was like a piece of clothing, which you could not _not_ have when going outside. The rage was infectious, and I soon caught on. I got my first Pokemon game as a birthday gift - Pokemon Sapphire.  \\n\\nSo, with great exuberance, I got my first Gym badge, saved my game and went to bed. The next day when I woke up, and loaded the game, I was greeted with this message:  \\n\\n\\n![]({filename}/images/deleted-file.jpg)\\n\\n\\nSerious disappointment. I tried saving again, but got the same message. I thought my Pokemaster career had come to a standstill, which it actually had. So, for the next few months, all I could do was gaze in envy at my friends' games which actually saved. Why only for a few months? Because, in February 2006, I got an original FireRed. With the same anxiousness, I tried saving, and obviously (but to my surprise), it actually worked! Joy. What followed was me getting an original Emerald as well, so I knew my career was well on its way. It was a lot of fun, when we were allowed to bring our GameBoys to school, and see whose Level 100 Mewtwo was better. I must clocked at least a total of 600 hours on both games, but in the middle of 2007, I was hit by a GameBoy ban, which didn't end till summer 2008. By then, I totally lost interest, and the GameBoy took its place as being a convenient paperweight and dust collector. Never touched it again for three years.  \\n\\nThen, in 2011, some of my friends came over with their GameBoys to ask me some Pokemon questions and how to get to Navel Rock without a GameShark. Of course, I had lost most of my expertise on the subject, and we never got to Navel Rock. But then, it brought back to me the fond memories of playing Pokemon, and thinking \\\"Hey, this is fun!\\\". The very next day, I downloaded an emulator and Emerald ROM, just to relive those moments.  \\n\\nIt was brilliant, playing Pokemon on that queer low-resolution and basic pseudo-2.5D models. I couldn't care less about the life-like graphics in other games. This was for me. I frantically hunted for my FireRed and Emerald cartridges, but both of them were lost. Lost forever. It was a heart-breaking moment.  \\n\\nSoon after, I began trawling sites like Bulbapedia and Serebii, to catch up on what I missed.  \\n\\nIt was an awful lot. But, looking closer, I saw a very sharp competitive edge to the game. I was amazed, and soon after, I swallowed the concept of EVs, IVs, and natures.  \\n\\nI downloaded Pokemon Platinum and DS emulator for fun. I never thought I would actually play it. I couldn't have been more wrong. I played the whole game and beat the Battle Frontier with all my newly-gained knowledge.  \\n\\nBut soon, I realised, there's no way of playing with a real person like this. So, I (nervously) asked my parents for a DS + Pokemon Black (I would've never asked, if I hadn't got scholarship). But that was easily the best things I could ever buy. A Cosmo Black 3DS and Pokemon Black. All I could've ever wanted. I've played around 70 Wi-Fi battles, and won like 30 of them. I turned to sites like [Smogon](http://smogon.com/). It was incredible, a whole community of smart, competitive Pokemon players. It was just the place for me. A few months ago, I became a member, and my Pokemon journey continues to advance.  \\n\\nThat's my story. Hope you guys liked it.

I tried saving again, but got the same message. I thought my Pokemaster career had come to a standstill, which it actually had. So, for the next few months, all I could do was gaze in envy at my friends' games which actually saved. Why only for a few months? Because, in February 2006, I got an original FireRed. With the same anxiousness, I tried saving, and obviously (but to my surprise), it actually worked! Joy. What followed was me getting an original Emerald as well, so I knew my career was well on its way. It was a lot of fun, when we were allowed to bring our GameBoys to school, and see whose Level 100 Mewtwo was better. I must clocked at least a total of 600 hours on both games, but in the middle of 2007, I was hit by a GameBoy ban, which didn't end till summer 2008. By then, I totally lost interest, and the GameBoy took its place as being a convenient paperweight and dust collector. Never touched it again for three years.  \\n\\nThen, in 2011, some of my friends came over with their GameBoys to ask me some Pokemon questions and how to get to Navel Rock without a GameShark. Of course, I had lost most of my expertise on the subject, and we never got to Navel Rock. But then, it brought back to me the fond memories of playing Pokemon, and thinking \\\"Hey, this is fun!\\\". The very next day, I downloaded an emulator and Emerald ROM, just to relive those moments.  \\n\\nIt was brilliant, playing Pokemon on that queer low-resolution and basic pseudo-2.5D models.

Today also represents the 1st anniversary of this blog, and hence, I present my new photography album.  \\n\\nMost of you would have already seen [Volume 2](/photography-volume-2) and [Volume 1](/photography), so you probably have an idea of my photography skills. I can only say that my skills have improved since then, as you will see in these photos.\\n\\nAll of these photos were shot in either Aperture Priority (Av) or Shutter Speed Priority (Tv) modes, a step forward from shooting in  Program (P) mode. I like exercising full control over the camera, though the camera does a better job than me in choosing shutter speeds for apertures, so Av is the mode of choice.  \\n\\nTechnical chatter aside; the photos (click to enlarge):  \\n\\n\\n![]({filename}/images/IMG_6748.JPG)\\n\\n\\n\\nLet's start off with this. A rare shot with two animals. I can't offer any opinion as to why the squirrel didn't run away from there or why the bird landed there in the first place, but using a wide aperture and high zoom did wonders here.\\n\\n\\n\\n![]({filename}/images/IMG_6770.JPG)\\n\\n\\nAnother squirrel? Well, actually it's the same one as in the previous picture. I'm at the risk of repeating photos over here, but this shot was way too good to pass up. The dark area which you see to the right of the image actually gives this photo a subtle effect and the squirrel's pose is fantastic. Using a digital camera gave me a wide choice of focal lengths without much adjustment. This one is 929 mm equivalent on a 35 mm film. Used f-stop 5.7 here, because wider apertures are beyond the camera's potential at these focal lengths.  \\n\\n\\n![]({filename}/images/IMG_6799.JPG)\\n\\n\\nPretty nice shot here as well. It looks like a macro shot, but this one was shot from afar. The sunflower looks great here, and the tiny ladybug on the petals is the icing on the cake (or should I say flower?). The background was perfectly suited for this shot, and gives a nice empty space for this photo.  \\n\\n\\n![]({filename}/images/IMG_6817.JPG)\\n\\n\\nI won't lie to you by saying that this picture was taken at a different location from the previous one. I like the bee's placement in the flower and the flower itself. The flies and the varieties of insects that adorn the flower also look good over here. The background is one of my favourite parts of this photo, with details blurred to put emphasis on the main flower, but visible at the same time. It's a hard balance to maintain, but I'm glad that it worked over here.  \\n\\n\\n![]({filename}/images/IMG_6972.JPG)\\n\\n\\nNothing special about the photography techniques over here, but photographing another creature, and a reptile at that was too good to pass up.  \\n\\n\\n![]({filename}/images/IMG_7304.JPG)\\n\\n\\nI suppose the colour over here is the main part of the photo. Clarity and contrast are also impressive. The flower itself looks exotic enough, though I have no idea what it is. Flowers are probably the best subjects in photography. They are quite beautiful, move very little and you can try a hundred different exposures to get the right shot.  \\n\\n\\n![]({filename}/images/IMG_7327.JPG)\\n\\n\\nWhile I'll be mean to call this an ugly butterfly (I'm sure it's not a moth!), I think it looks magnificent over here. Although eye-pleasing colours are practically non-existent in this photo, you should look at the contrast of the ground to the insect. It looks pretty good, and the other insects around the butterfly provide a level of detail, without which, this photo would look much plainer.  \\n\\n\\n![]({filename}/images/IMG_7331.JPG)\\n\\n\\nProbably one of the best shots I took on that day. The coconut as a subject may make you raise eyebrows, but it's totally unlike anything else I've shot. The focusing was perfect here, giving the photo a very small depth of field. Less can be more and this shot exemplifies it.  \\n\\n\\n![]({filename}/images/IMG_7583.JPG)\\n\\n\\nYou might've seen that I've only done close-up shots. This is one of the very few landscape shots I've taken. Excellent scenery and I really don't have much more to say about this.  \\n\\n\\n![]({filename}/images/IMG_7843.JPG)\\n\\n\\nThe mynah had a nice stance and perching position for this. The background is suitably blurred over here and the foreground falls into focus nicely. The background is great for this and the bird's details are captured with some success.  \\n\\n\\n![]({filename}/images/IMG_8064.JPG)\\n\\n\\nIt might look odd to photograph only the head of a peacock without its resplendent body. But the head itself actually has fantastic detail. The blue colour stands out superbly and there is a generous amount of empty space in the photo which is essential for greater emphasis on the bird. An unorthodox, but great shot.  \\n\\nThat's it folks!

A rare shot with two animals. I can't offer any opinion as to why the squirrel didn't run away from there or why the bird landed there in the first place, but using a wide aperture and high zoom did wonders here.\\n\\n\\n\\n![]({filename}/images/IMG_6770.JPG)\\n\\n\\nAnother squirrel? Well, actually it's the same one as in the previous picture. I'm at the risk of repeating photos over here, but this shot was way too good to pass up. The dark area which you see to the right of the image actually gives this photo a subtle effect and the squirrel's pose is fantastic. Using a digital camera gave me a wide choice of focal lengths without much adjustment. This one is 929 mm equivalent on a 35 mm film. Used f-stop 5.7 here, because wider apertures are beyond the camera's potential at these focal lengths.  \\n\\n\\n![]({filename}/images/IMG_6799.JPG)\\n\\n\\nPretty nice shot here as well. It looks like a macro shot, but this one was shot from afar. The sunflower looks great here, and the tiny ladybug on the petals is the icing on the cake (or should I say flower?). The background was perfectly suited for this shot, and gives a nice empty space for this photo.  \\n\\n\\n![]({filename}/images/IMG_6817.JPG)\\n\\n\\nI won't lie to you by saying that this picture was taken at a different location from the previous one. I like the bee's placement in the flower and the flower itself. The flies and the varieties of insects that adorn the flower also look good over here. The background is one of my favourite parts of this photo, with details blurred to put emphasis on the main flower, but visible at the same time. It's a hard balance to maintain, but I'm glad that it worked over here.  \\n\\n\\n![]({filename}/images/IMG_6972.JPG)\\n\\n\\nNothing special about the photography techniques over here, but photographing another creature, and a reptile at that was too good to pass up.  \\n\\n\\n![]({filename}/images/IMG_7304.JPG)\\n\\n\\nI suppose the colour over here is the main part of the photo. Clarity and contrast are also impressive. The flower itself looks exotic enough, though I have no idea what it is. Flowers are probably the best subjects in photography. They are quite beautiful, move very little and you can try a hundred different exposures to get the right shot.  \\n\\n\\n![]({filename}/images/IMG_7327.JPG)\\n\\n\\nWhile I'll be mean to call this an ugly butterfly (I'm sure it's not a moth!), I think it looks magnificent over here. Although eye-pleasing colours are practically non-existent in this photo, you should look at the contrast of the ground to the insect. It looks pretty good, and the other insects around the butterfly provide a level of detail, without which, this photo would look much plainer.  \\n\\n\\n![]({filename}/images/IMG_7331.JPG)\\n\\n\\nProbably one of the best shots I took on that day. The coconut as a subject may make you raise eyebrows, but it's totally unlike anything else I've shot. The focusing was perfect here, giving the photo a very small depth of field. Less can be more and this shot exemplifies it.  \\n\\n\\n![]({filename}/images/IMG_7583.JPG)\\n\\n\\nYou might've seen that I've only done close-up shots. This is one of the very few landscape shots I've taken. Excellent scenery and I really don't have much more to say about this.  \\n\\n\\n![]({filename}/images/IMG_7843.JPG)\\n\\n\\nThe mynah had a nice stance and perching position for this.

The background is great for this and the bird's details are captured with some success.  \\n\\n\\n![]({filename}/images/IMG_8064.JPG)\\n\\n\\nIt might look odd to photograph only the head of a peacock without its resplendent body. But the head itself actually has fantastic detail. The blue colour stands out superbly and there is a generous amount of empty space in the photo which is essential for greater emphasis on the bird.

I can only say that my skills have improved since then, as you will see in these photos.\\n\\nAll of these photos were shot in either Aperture Priority (Av) or Shutter Speed Priority (Tv) modes, a step forward from shooting in  Program (P) mode. I like exercising full control over the camera, though the camera does a better job than me in choosing shutter speeds for apertures, so Av is the mode of choice.  \\n\\nTechnical chatter aside; the photos (click to enlarge):  \\n\\n\\n![IMG_6748](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_6748.JPG)\\n\\n\\nLet's start off with this. A rare shot with two animals. I can't offer any opinion as to why the squirrel didn't run away from there or why the bird landed there in the first place, but using a wide aperture and high zoom did wonders here.\\n\\n\\n\\n![IMG_6770](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_6770.JPG)\\n\\nAnother squirrel? Well, actually it's the same one as in the previous picture. I'm at the risk of repeating photos over here, but this shot was way too good to pass up. The dark area which you see to the right of the image actually gives this photo a subtle effect and the squirrel's pose is fantastic. Using a digital camera gave me a wide choice of focal lengths without much adjustment. This one is 929 mm equivalent on a 35 mm film. Used f-stop 5.7 here, because wider apertures are beyond the camera's potential at these focal lengths.  \\n\\n\\n![IMG_6799](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_6799.JPG)\\n\\nPretty nice shot here as well. It looks like a macro shot, but this one was shot from afar. The sunflower looks great here, and the tiny ladybug on the petals is the icing on the cake (or should I say flower?). The background was perfectly suited for this shot, and gives a nice empty space for this photo.  \\n\\n\\n![IMG_6817](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_6817.JPG)\\n\\nI won't lie to you by saying that this picture was taken at a different location from the previous one. I like the bee's placement in the flower and the flower itself. The flies and the varieties of insects that adorn the flower also look good over here. The background is one of my favourite parts of this photo, with details blurred to put emphasis on the main flower, but visible at the same time. It's a hard balance to maintain, but I'm glad that it worked over here.  \\n\\n\\n![]({filename}/images/IMG_6972.JPG)\\n\\n\\nNothing special about the photography techniques over here, but photographing another creature, and a reptile at that was too good to pass up.  \\n\\n\\n![]({filename}/images/IMG_7304.JPG)\\n\\n\\nI suppose the colour over here is the main part of the photo. Clarity and contrast are also impressive. The flower itself looks exotic enough, though I have no idea what it is. Flowers are probably the best subjects in photography. They are quite beautiful, move very little and you can try a hundred different exposures to get the right shot.  \\n\\n\\n![]({filename}/images/IMG_7327.JPG)\\n\\n\\nWhile I'll be mean to call this an ugly butterfly (I'm sure it's not a moth!), I think it looks magnificent over here. Although eye-pleasing colours are practically non-existent in this photo, you should look at the contrast of the ground to the insect. It looks pretty good, and the other insects around the butterfly provide a level of detail, without which, this photo would look much plainer.  \\n\\n\\n![]({filename}/images/IMG_7331.JPG)\\n\\n\\nProbably one of the best shots I took on that day. The coconut as a subject may make you raise eyebrows, but it's totally unlike anything else I've shot. The focusing was perfect here, giving the photo a very small depth of field. Less can be more and this shot exemplifies it.  \\n\\n\\n![]({filename}/images/IMG_7583.JPG)\\n\\n\\nYou might've seen that I've only done close-up shots.

A rare shot with two animals. I can't offer any opinion as to why the squirrel didn't run away from there or why the bird landed there in the first place, but using a wide aperture and high zoom did wonders here.\\n\\n\\n\\n![IMG_6770](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_6770.JPG)\\n\\nAnother squirrel? Well, actually it's the same one as in the previous picture. I'm at the risk of repeating photos over here, but this shot was way too good to pass up. The dark area which you see to the right of the image actually gives this photo a subtle effect and the squirrel's pose is fantastic. Using a digital camera gave me a wide choice of focal lengths without much adjustment. This one is 929 mm equivalent on a 35 mm film. Used f-stop 5.7 here, because wider apertures are beyond the camera's potential at these focal lengths.  \\n\\n\\n![IMG_6799](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_6799.JPG)\\n\\nPretty nice shot here as well. It looks like a macro shot, but this one was shot from afar. The sunflower looks great here, and the tiny ladybug on the petals is the icing on the cake (or should I say flower?). The background was perfectly suited for this shot, and gives a nice empty space for this photo.  \\n\\n\\n![IMG_6817](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_6817.JPG)\\n\\nI won't lie to you by saying that this picture was taken at a different location from the previous one. I like the bee's placement in the flower and the flower itself. The flies and the varieties of insects that adorn the flower also look good over here. The background is one of my favourite parts of this photo, with details blurred to put emphasis on the main flower, but visible at the same time. It's a hard balance to maintain, but I'm glad that it worked over here.  \\n\\n\\n![IMG_6972](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_6972.JPG)\\n\\nNothing special about the photography techniques over here, but photographing another creature, and a reptile at that was too good to pass up.  \\n\\n\\n![IMG_7304](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_7304.JPG)\\n\\nI suppose the colour over here is the main part of the photo. Clarity and contrast are also impressive. The flower itself looks exotic enough, though I have no idea what it is. Flowers are probably the best subjects in photography. They are quite beautiful, move very little and you can try a hundred different exposures to get the right shot.  \\n\\n\\n![IMG_7327](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_7327.JPG)\\n\\nWhile I'll be mean to call this an ugly butterfly (I'm sure it's not a moth!), I think it looks magnificent over here.

I can only say that my skills have improved since then, as you will see in these photos.\\n\\nAll of these photos were shot in either Aperture Priority (Av) or Shutter Speed Priority (Tv) modes, a step forward from shooting in  Program (P) mode.

Well, actually it's the same one as in the previous picture. I'm at the risk of repeating photos over here, but this shot was way too good to pass up. The dark area which you see to the right of the image actually gives this photo a subtle effect and the squirrel's pose is fantastic. Using a digital camera gave me a wide choice of focal lengths without much adjustment. This one is 929 mm equivalent on a 35 mm film. Used f-stop 5.7 here, because wider apertures are beyond the camera's potential at these focal lengths.  \\n\\n\\n![IMG_6799](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_6799.JPG)\\n\\nPretty nice shot here as well. It looks like a macro shot, but this one was shot from afar. The sunflower looks great here, and the tiny ladybug on the petals is the icing on the cake (or should I say flower?).

I can only say that my skills have improved since then, as you will see in these photos.\\n\\nAll of these photos were shot in either Aperture Priority (Av) or Shutter Speed Priority (Tv) modes, a step forward from shooting in  Program (P) mode. I like exercising full control over the camera, though the camera does a better job than me in choosing shutter speeds for apertures, so Av is the mode of choice.  \\n\\nTechnical chatter aside; the photos (click to enlarge):  \\n\\n\\n![IMG_6748](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_6748.JPG)\\n\\n\\nLet's start off with this. A rare shot with two animals. I can't offer any opinion as to why the squirrel didn't run away from there or why the bird landed there in the first place, but using a wide aperture and high zoom did wonders here.\\n\\n\\n\\n![IMG_6770](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_6770.JPG)\\n\\nAnother squirrel? Well, actually it's the same one as in the previous picture. I'm at the risk of repeating photos over here, but this shot was way too good to pass up. The dark area which you see to the right of the image actually gives this photo a subtle effect and the squirrel's pose is fantastic. Using a digital camera gave me a wide choice of focal lengths without much adjustment. This one is 929 mm equivalent on a 35 mm film. Used f-stop 5.7 here, because wider apertures are beyond the camera's potential at these focal lengths.  \\n\\n\\n![IMG_6799](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_6799.JPG)\\n\\nPretty nice shot here as well. It looks like a macro shot, but this one was shot from afar. The sunflower looks great here, and the tiny ladybug on the petals is the icing on the cake (or should I say flower?). The background was perfectly suited for this shot, and gives a nice empty space for this photo.  \\n\\n\\n![IMG_6817](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_6817.JPG)\\n\\nI won't lie to you by saying that this picture was taken at a different location from the previous one. I like the bee's placement in the flower and the flower itself. The flies and the varieties of insects that adorn the flower also look good over here. The background is one of my favourite parts of this photo, with details blurred to put emphasis on the main flower, but visible at the same time. It's a hard balance to maintain, but I'm glad that it worked over here.  \\n\\n\\n![IMG_6972](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_6972.JPG)\\n\\nNothing special about the photography techniques over here, but photographing another creature, and a reptile at that was too good to pass up.  \\n\\n\\n![IMG_7304](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_7304.JPG)\\n\\nI suppose the colour over here is the main part of the photo. Clarity and contrast are also impressive. The flower itself looks exotic enough, though I have no idea what it is. Flowers are probably the best subjects in photography. They are quite beautiful, move very little and you can try a hundred different exposures to get the right shot.  \\n\\n\\n![IMG_7327](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_7327.JPG)\\n\\nWhile I'll be mean to call this an ugly butterfly (I'm sure it's not a moth!), I think it looks magnificent over here. Although eye-pleasing colours are practically non-existent in this photo, you should look at the contrast of the ground to the insect. It looks pretty good, and the other insects around the butterfly provide a level of detail, without which, this photo would look much plainer.  \\n\\n\\n![IMG_7331](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_7331.JPG)\\n\\nProbably one of the best shots I took on that day. The coconut as a subject may make you raise eyebrows, but it's totally unlike anything else I've shot. The focusing was perfect here, giving the photo a very small depth of field.

It's been months since my last blog post, owing quite a bit to 10th grade and other activities. However, I'm back with a new, special post on what makes me tick behind the lens!  \\n\\nTake this as my guide to hobbyist digital photography. I hope you enjoy it!  \\n\\n\\n* _Find something interesting to photograph:_ While this might sound obvious, this is probably one of the most difficult things to accomplish in photography. A photo is a work of art: it needs to convey feelings, emotions, and beauty. If you don't have anything which can capture any of those three important guidelines, chances are you will end up with a dull photo. Photography isn't all about luscious landscapes or crafted close-ups. If you have a good degree of imagination, you can make anything look like a professional grade photograph, which brings me to my second point.  \\n\\n\\n* _Be imaginative:_ It's good to have a hard drive worth of photos shot at landmarks all over the world, but to be honest, you don't need that to be a good photographer. Imagination is probably the best thing that can change a common photo into a modern masterpiece. Just look outside your window. If you look closely and carefully for long enough, you'll definitely find something that can make an excellent photograph. Mess around with perspectives and your camera's settings and shutter times, and see what you get!  \\n\\n* _You don't need the best camera to take good photos:_ Don't get me wrong here, you're never going to get a high-grade photo from your 5-year old smartphone's camera. However, while it is no myth that a Canon 5D Mark III will consistently outperform your handy digital point-and-shoot camera, there's so much more to photography than just the camera and lens. Photographers need to have a good eye for detail and if you're not blessed with that, you can say farewell to all the awesome photos you thought you were going to shoot with your new DSLR. Having an eye for detail results in some wonderful photographs even with the most mediocre of cameras. I wouldn't call my Canon SX1-IS PowerShot (the camera which I've used to photograph all the photos posted on this blog) mediocre: it's actually a pretty good digital prosumer, but it's true that there are a huge bunch of DSLRs which exceed it in image quality.   \\n\\nHowever, if you are fortunate enough to own a high-end camera and you have a passion for photography, chances are that you will be shooting like a pro in no time. A lower end camera won't offer you all the advanced features a prosumer/DSLR offers, but it'll do just fine for capturing most photos. Don't forget to keep lighting in mind, lighting conditions are very detrimental to taking good photos.\\n\\n* _Learn about your camera:_ This is very important. You might say, \\\"Hey, my camera's got a brilliant Automatic mode, I don't need to learn about nerdy photography terms!\\\" While it is true to an extent that camera nowadays are getting smarter and are able to deliver quality pictures even with minimal adjustment, you should learn about photography lingo right after you get comfortable with your camera. Why do you need to get comfortable first? That's because getting swamped with all the things you need to know to photograph with reasonable quality, isn't really the best way to start off your career in photography.  \\n\\nJust to give you a quick example, learn about terms such as: f-stops for Aperture, Shutter Speed (both are very important), ISO Film, digital noise, chromatic aberration, focal lengths, light metering, and the golden combination of all these things that make a good photo! A good photographer needs to thoroughly understand and know all these things to figure out how each one affects one another. Although it may seem daunting at first, I can tell you from personal experience that all it needs is just a few rounds of taking photos for one hour and a little bit of reading.\\n\\n* _Get out there!:_ Photos are never going to shoot themselves You need to be behind the camera and you need to be ready to experiment a lot to have a collection of quality photographs. It can seem impossible to take a good photo at times, but not everything can be photographed just the way you might want it to be. Learn from your own experiences and read up on how you can improve. I can safely bet with you that your experience will teach you more about photography than I, or any book can!\\n\\nIf you've been patient enough to read all this, I wish you the best of luck in diving into the wonderful world of digital photography!  \\n\\nComments are much appreciated Thanks for reading!  \\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","page":false,"slug":"untitled","status":"draft","title":"(Untitled)","updated_at":"2018-08-13T18:39:24.000Z","authors":{"0":{"id":"1","name":"arnav dhamija","slug":"arnav","email":"arnav.dhamija@gmail.com","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"accessibility":"{\"nightShift\":true}","status":"active","locale":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"last_seen":{},"created_at":{},"updated_at":{},"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\",\"upload-a-theme\",\"using-the-editor\"]"}},"tags":{}}}},"query":{"include":"authors,tags,authors.roles"}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"no-cache, private, no-store, must-revalidate, max-stale=0, post-check=0, pre-check=0","x-cache-invalidate":"/p/f1c799b3-289b-4807-9f8a-d2b01134d77c/","content-type":"application/json; charset=utf-8","etag":"W/\"1be9-EsYs/M+sd3VJ1MNEuOvKAvQonXY\"","vary":"Accept-Encoding","content-encoding":"gzip"},"statusCode":200,"responseTime":"232ms"},"msg":"","time":"2018-08-13T18:39:28.230Z","v":0}

It's been months since my last blog post, owing quite a bit to 10th grade and other activities. However, I'm back with a new, special post on what makes me tick behind the lens!  \\n\\nTake this as my guide to hobbyist digital photography. I hope you enjoy it!  \\n\\n\\n* _Find something interesting to photograph:_ While this might sound obvious, this is probably one of the most difficult things to accomplish in photography. A photo is a work of art: it needs to convey feelings, emotions, and beauty. If you don't have anything which can capture any of those three important guidelines, chances are you will end up with a dull photo. Photography isn't all about luscious landscapes or crafted close-ups. If you have a good degree of imagination, you can make anything look like a professional grade photograph, which brings me to my second point.  \\n\\n\\n* _Be imaginative:_ It's good to have a hard drive worth of photos shot at landmarks all over the world, but to be honest, you don't need that to be a good photographer. Imagination is probably the best thing that can change a common photo into a modern masterpiece. Just look outside your window. If you look closely and carefully for long enough, you'll definitely find something that can make an excellent photograph. Mess around with perspectives and your camera's settings and shutter times, and see what you get!  \\n\\n* _You don't need the best camera to take good photos:_ Don't get me wrong here, you're never going to get a high-grade photo from your 5-year old smartphone's camera. However, while it is no myth that a Canon 5D Mark III will consistently outperform your handy digital point-and-shoot camera, there's so much more to photography than just the camera and lens. Photographers need to have a good eye for detail and if you're not blessed with that, you can say farewell to all the awesome photos you thought you were going to shoot with your new DSLR. Having an eye for detail results in some wonderful photographs even with the most mediocre of cameras. I wouldn't call my Canon SX1-IS PowerShot (the camera which I've used to photograph all the photos posted on this blog) mediocre: it's actually a pretty good digital prosumer, but it's true that there are a huge bunch of DSLRs which exceed it in image quality.   \\n\\nHowever, if you are fortunate enough to own a high-end camera and you have a passion for photography, chances are that you will be shooting like a pro in no time. A lower end camera won't offer you all the advanced features a prosumer/DSLR offers, but it'll do just fine for capturing most photos. Don't forget to keep lighting in mind, lighting conditions are very detrimental to taking good photos.\\n\\n* _Learn about your camera:_ This is very important. You might say, \\\"Hey, my camera's got a brilliant Automatic mode, I don't need to learn about nerdy photography terms!\\\" While it is true to an extent that camera nowadays are getting smarter and are able to deliver quality pictures even with minimal adjustment, you should learn about photography lingo right after you get comfortable with your camera. Why do you need to get comfortable first? That's because getting swamped with all the things you need to know to photograph with reasonable quality, isn't really the best way to start off your career in photography.  \\n\\nJust to give you a quick example, learn about terms such as: f-stops for Aperture, Shutter Speed (both are very important), ISO Film, digital noise, chromatic aberration, focal lengths, light metering, and the golden combination of all these things that make a good photo! A good photographer needs to thoroughly understand and know all these things to figure out how each one affects one another. Although it may seem daunting at first, I can tell you from personal experience that all it needs is just a few rounds of taking photos for one hour and a little bit of reading.\\n\\n* _Get out there!:_ Photos are never going to shoot themselves You need to be behind the camera and you need to be ready to experiment a lot to have a collection of quality photographs. It can seem impossible to take a good photo at times, but not everything can be photographed just the way you might want it to be. Learn from your own experiences and read up on how you can improve. I can safely bet with you that your experience will teach you more about photography than I, or any book can!\\n\\nIf you've been patient enough to read all this, I wish you the best of luck in diving into the wonderful world of digital photography!  \\n\\nComments are much appreciated Thanks for reading!  \\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","page":false,"published_at":"2012-09-09T14:56:00.000Z","slug":"photography-protips","status":"published","title":"Photography Protips!","updated_at":"2018-08-13T18:40:14.000Z","authors":{"0":{"id":"1","name":"arnav dhamija","slug":"arnav","email":"arnav.dhamija@gmail.com","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"accessibility":"{\"nightShift\":true}","status":"active","locale":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"last_seen":{},"created_at":{},"updated_at":{},"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\",\"upload-a-theme\",\"using-the-editor\"]"}},"tags":{"0":{"id":"5b71c9a6dd62db5a3cfa0368","name":"Photography","slug":"photography","description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","created_at":{},"updated_at":{},"parent_id":null}}}}},"query":{"include":"authors,tags,authors.roles"}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"no-cache, private, no-store, must-revalidate, max-stale=0, post-check=0, pre-check=0","x-cache-invalidate":"/*","content-type":"application/json; charset=utf-8","etag":"W/\"1e94-sNzaxT1NrOaxU3L/u7XUly4NRo8\"","vary":"Accept-Encoding","content-encoding":"gzip"},"statusCode":200,"responseTime":"213ms"},"msg":"","time":"2018-08-13T18:40:32.610Z","v":0}

Recently bought myself some free time to publish a brand new blog post, centred on my photography work!\\n\\nI guess I also owe all of my avid readers an apology: it's been a really long time since my last photography post, so I hope I can make it up to you in this one!\\n\\nMy previous photography posts:\\n\\n[Volume 3](/2012/05/08/photography-volume-3/)\\n\\n[Volume 2](/2012/03/20/photography-volume-2/)\\n\\n[Volume 1](/2011/10/19/photography-volume-1/)\\n\\nAs usual, just click to enlarge!\\n\\nStarting off:\\n\\n![]({filename}/images/IMG_1013.JPG)\\n\\nI'm really in need of an anthropologist here. I found this insect whilst walking down the road when a speck of orange caught my eye. Turns out that that speck of orange is one of the finest six-legged creatures I've ever seen. From a photography stand-point, I used a wide aperture, and a large zoom to capture this.\\n\\n![]({filename}/images/IMG_2608.JPG)\\n\\nThis is probably one of the most comical insect/bug pictures that I've ever taken. The DoF worked excellently over here; it only puts the subject in focus. The first thing that came to my mind after I shot this was \\\"suicide\\\". Definitely one of my favourite shots.\\n\\n![]({filename}/images/IMG_4283.JPG)\\n\\nYay, another bug! I'm really scared of wasps, but that's the good thing about a superzoom camera: you can stand far away and still get a crisp shot. Pretty much the same ingredients were used to make this shot as the previous two.\\n\\n![]({filename}/images/IMG_4286.JPG)\\n\\nI should really call this post \\\"Bugs and Insects Special Album!\\\" or something. Poor jokes aside, I love the way the insect was climbing on the stigma/anthers (not too sure) of the flower. The background is sublimely blurred, but there's still enough detail to keep the background interesting. Top shot.\\n\\n![]({filename}/images/IMG_4301.JPG)\\n\\nThis is one picture I really like, but sometimes I feel remorseful seeing it. Although the reptile is in excellent focus, the handle of the water tap to the right distracts attention from it. Just goes to show that you can't always expect perfect conditions for photography.\\n\\n![]({filename}/images/IMG_4564.JPG)\\n\\nNo photography album is complete without a good flower. This is easily one of the prettiest flowers I've ever shot. Although I'm not too happy with the background, the foreground more than makes up for it.\\n\\n![]({filename}/images/IMG_4382.JPG)\\n\\nYou're probably sick of seeing close-ups now, so I thought I'd throw in this picture that I took at sunset.  Everything worked in this photo, the orange clouds, the lovely Tyndall effect coming from the sun, and the coconut trees below.\\n\\n![]({filename}/images/IMG_4479.JPG)\\n\\nAnother close-up! If I had to pass any comment about this, I would point out the robin's leisurely stride. It seems so relaxed, almost as if in a dream- like trance. Never mind my comments, post your own!\\n\\n![]({filename}/images/IMG_4845.JPG)\\n\\nI really like this one. It's a very personified shot, the way the bird on the left is trying to say something, and the one on the right is taciturn and unwilling to respond. Their seating on the rocks is perfect and I also like the way they chose to pose right in front of the water-body.\\n\\n![]({filename}/images/IMG_4884.JPG)\\n\\n![]({filename}/images/IMG_4892.JPG)\\n\\nI'm sorry if I've made you wince by showing you another insect picture (it has been enough of those!).

Recently bought myself some free time to publish a brand new blog post, centred on my photography work!\\n\\nI guess I also owe all of my avid readers an apology: it's been a really long time since my last photography post, so I hope I can make it up to you in this one!\\n\\nMy previous photography posts:\\n\\n[Volume 3](/2012/05/08/photography-volume-3/)\\n\\n[Volume 2](/2012/03/20/photography-volume-2/)\\n\\n[Volume 1](/2011/10/19/photography-volume-1/)\\n\\nAs usual, just click to enlarge!\\n\\nStarting off:\\n\\n![IMG_1013](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_1013.JPG)\\nI'm really in need of an anthropologist here. I found this insect whilst walking down the road when a speck of orange caught my eye. Turns out that that speck of orange is one of the finest six-legged creatures I've ever seen. From a photography stand-point, I used a wide aperture, and a large zoom to capture this.\\n\\n![IMG_2608](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_2608.JPG)\\nThis is probably one of the most comical insect/bug pictures that I've ever taken. The DoF worked excellently over here; it only puts the subject in focus. The first thing that came to my mind after I shot this was \\\"suicide\\\". Definitely one of my favourite shots.\\n\\n![IMG_4283](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_4283.JPG)\\nYay, another bug! I'm really scared of wasps, but that's the good thing about a superzoom camera: you can stand far away and still get a crisp shot. Pretty much the same ingredients were used to make this shot as the previous two.\\n\\n![IMG_4286](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_4286.JPG)\\nI should really call this post \\\"Bugs and Insects Special Album!\\\" or something. Poor jokes aside, I love the way the insect was climbing on the stigma/anthers (not too sure) of the flower. The background is sublimely blurred, but there's still enough detail to keep the background interesting. Top shot.\\n\\n![IMG_4301](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_4301.JPG)\\nThis is one picture I really like, but sometimes I feel remorseful seeing it. Although the reptile is in excellent focus, the handle of the water tap to the right distracts attention from it. Just goes to show that you can't always expect perfect conditions for photography.\\n\\n![IMG_4564](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_4564.JPG)\\nNo photography album is complete without a good flower. This is easily one of the prettiest flowers I've ever shot. Although I'm not too happy with the background, the foreground more than makes up for it.\\n\\n![IMG_4382](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_4382.JPG)\\nYou're probably sick of seeing close-ups now, so I thought I'd throw in this picture that I took at sunset.  Everything worked in this photo, the orange clouds, the lovely Tyndall effect coming from the sun, and the coconut trees below.\\n\\n![IMG_4479](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_4479.JPG)\\nAnother close-up! If I had to pass any comment about this, I would point out the robin's leisurely stride. It seems so relaxed, almost as if in a dream- like trance. Never mind my comments, post your own!\\n\\n![IMG_4845](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_4845.JPG)\\nI really like this one. It's a very personified shot, the way the bird on the left is trying to say something, and the one on the right is taciturn and unwilling to respond. Their seating on the rocks is perfect and I also like the way they chose to pose right in front of the water-body.\\n\\n![IMG_4884](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_4884.JPG)\\n![IMG_4892](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_4892.JPG)\\n\\nI'm sorry if I've made you wince by showing you another insect picture (it has been enough of those!). Nevertheless, I'm really proud about taking these shots. They're both images of the same dragonfly from different angles. The first one has a nice background and excellent detail, while the second one exhibits a minimalistic appearance, with little to distract from the dragonfly itself.\\n\\nThat's all for now! Please criticize, praise, and comment!\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","page":false,"published_at":"2012-10-25T09:41:00.000Z","slug":"photography-volume-4","status":"published","title":"Photography: Volume 4","updated_at":"2018-08-13T18:45:17.000Z","authors":{"0":{"id":"1","name":"arnav dhamija","slug":"arnav","email":"arnav.dhamija@gmail.com","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"accessibility":"{\"nightShift\":true}","status":"active","locale":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"last_seen":{},"created_at":{},"updated_at":{},"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\",\"upload-a-theme\",\"using-the-editor\"]"}},"tags":{"0":{"id":"5b71c9a6dd62db5a3cfa0368","name":"Photography","slug":"photography","description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","created_at":{},"updated_at":{},"parent_id":null}}}}},"query":{"include":"authors,tags,authors.roles"}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"no-cache, private, no-store, must-revalidate, max-stale=0, post-check=0, pre-check=0","x-cache-invalidate":"/*","content-type":"application/json; charset=utf-8","etag":"W/\"1cb0-exRHB8C2xdlilGi/hW5XAxJh2e0\"","vary":"Accept-Encoding","content-encoding":"gzip"},"statusCode":200,"responseTime":"241ms"},"msg":"","time":"2018-08-13T18:45:25.933Z","v":0}

Recently bought myself some free time to publish a brand new blog post, centred on my photography work!\\n\\nI guess I also owe all of my avid readers an apology: it's been a really long time since my last photography post, so I hope I can make it up to you in this one!\\n\\nMy previous photography posts:\\n\\n[Volume 3](/2012/05/08/photography-volume-3/)\\n\\n[Volume 2](/2012/03/20/photography-volume-2/)\\n\\n[Volume 1](/2011/10/19/photography-volume-1/)\\n\\nAs usual, just click to enlarge!\\n\\nStarting off:\\n\\n![IMG_1013](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_1013.JPG)\\nI'm really in need of an entomologist here. I found this insect whilst walking down the road when a speck of orange caught my eye. Turns out that that speck of orange is one of the finest six-legged creatures I've ever seen. From a photography stand-point, I used a wide aperture, and a large zoom to capture this.\\n\\n![IMG_2608](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_2608.JPG)\\nThis is probably one of the most comical insect/bug pictures that I've ever taken. The DoF worked excellently over here; it only puts the subject in focus. The first thing that came to my mind after I shot this was \\\"suicide\\\". Definitely one of my favourite shots.\\n\\n![IMG_4283](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_4283.JPG)\\nYay, another bug! I'm really scared of wasps, but that's the good thing about a superzoom camera: you can stand far away and still get a crisp shot. Pretty much the same ingredients were used to make this shot as the previous two.\\n\\n![IMG_4286](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_4286.JPG)\\nI should really call this post \\\"Bugs and Insects Special Album!\\\" or something. Poor jokes aside, I love the way the insect was climbing on the stigma/anthers (not too sure) of the flower. The background is sublimely blurred, but there's still enough detail to keep the background interesting. Top shot.\\n\\n![IMG_4301](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_4301.JPG)\\nThis is one picture I really like, but sometimes I feel remorseful seeing it. Although the reptile is in excellent focus, the handle of the water tap to the right distracts attention from it. Just goes to show that you can't always expect perfect conditions for photography.\\n\\n![IMG_4564](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_4564.JPG)\\nNo photography album is complete without a good flower. This is easily one of the prettiest flowers I've ever shot. Although I'm not too happy with the background, the foreground more than makes up for it.\\n\\n![IMG_4382](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_4382.JPG)\\nYou're probably sick of seeing close-ups now, so I thought I'd throw in this picture that I took at sunset.  Everything worked in this photo, the orange clouds, the lovely Tyndall effect coming from the sun, and the coconut trees below.\\n\\n![IMG_4479](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_4479.JPG)\\nAnother close-up! If I had to pass any comment about this, I would point out the robin's leisurely stride. It seems so relaxed, almost as if in a dream- like trance. Never mind my comments, post your own!\\n\\n![IMG_4845](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_4845.JPG)\\nI really like this one. It's a very personified shot, the way the bird on the left is trying to say something, and the one on the right is taciturn and unwilling to respond. Their seating on the rocks is perfect and I also like the way they chose to pose right in front of the water-body.\\n\\n![IMG_4884](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_4884.JPG)\\n![IMG_4892](/content/images/2018/08/IMG_4892.JPG)\\n\\nI'm sorry if I've made you wince by showing you another insect picture (it has been enough of those!). Nevertheless, I'm really proud about taking these shots. They're both images of the same dragonfly from different angles. The first one has a nice background and excellent detail, while the second one exhibits a minimalistic appearance, with little to distract from the dragonfly itself.\\n\\nThat's all for now! Please criticize, praise, and comment!\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","page":false,"published_at":"2012-10-25T09:41:00.000Z","slug":"photography-volume-4","status":"published","title":"Photography: Volume 4","updated_at":"2018-08-13T18:45:25.000Z","authors":{"0":{"id":"1","name":"arnav dhamija","slug":"arnav","email":"arnav.dhamija@gmail.com","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"accessibility":"{\"nightShift\":true}","status":"active","locale":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"last_seen":{},"created_at":{},"updated_at":{},"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\",\"upload-a-theme\",\"using-the-editor\"]"}},"tags":{"0":{"id":"5b71c9a6dd62db5a3cfa0368","name":"Photography","slug":"photography","description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","created_at":{},"updated_at":{},"parent_id":null}}}}},"query":{"include":"authors,tags,authors.roles"}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"no-cache, private, no-store, must-revalidate, max-stale=0, post-check=0, pre-check=0","x-cache-invalidate":"/*","content-type":"application/json; charset=utf-8","etag":"W/\"1cae-oSFEgmI3Qtvh8BXY8kKxJVlhGig\"","vary":"Accept-Encoding","content-encoding":"gzip"},"statusCode":200,"responseTime":"148ms"},"msg":"","time":"2018-08-13T18:46:05.926Z","v":0}

I don't know if anyone still reads this blog, but I sure appreciate if you do!  \\n\\nSo, I guess some explanation is due here - it's been a combination of my lack of cohesive thought and lack of motivation to publish anything. Part of the reason is also that I've given a shot at the IIT-JEE which is something that I've wanted to write about for a while.  \\n\\nFor the uninitiated, the IIT-JEE is an entrance exam for the IITs which are regarded by some as the best engineering colleges in India. The exam is held at the end of 12th grade annually. Hundreds of thousands attempt the exam. Tens of thousands slog away countless hours of their last few years in high school preparing for it. Only a few hundred actually succeed.  \\n\\nLike many with some strong aspirations of becoming an engineer, I stumbled upon this path a couple of years ago. I loved making/breaking things and had (what I felt) a keen interest in science, so it was a natural option for me to take some engineering related field over other options. I loved airplanes too and I would spend many happy hours on Wikipedia reading up about the Concorde (gorgeous plane), the XB-70, their engines, their airframe designs, and the engineers behind it all. I was fiercely determined to enter the aviation industry as an aerospace engineer to create a revolutionary aircraft on the lines of the Concorde.\\n\\nIt's an unspoken reality that one's chances at IIT-JEE significantly decrease without the assistance of extra classes outside school, also known as coaching classes. I joined one at the start of the summer vacation prior to 11th called FIITJEE after getting a decent fee waiver via their admission test. I was no stranger to horror stories of 11th and 12th grade for school students, but I felt things would change for the better after the brain-numbing syllabus of 10th grade.  \\n\\nAnd it did. To an extent. Things passed very quickly through the first few months of FIITJEE where I was tirelessly trying to understand every fragment of information that would probably help in making it through with a good rank in IIT Advance. My math wasn't strongest to begin with and I trudged along with chem with ambivalence to the subject material. Studying physics, both in class and at home was amazing. Thanks to our FIITJEE physics teacher, one of the best teachers I've ever had, physics by acompared long shot became my favorite subject for the next two years. It always just clicked and moreover studying physics and learning something new to solve an interesting problem was just _fun_. I remember physics and chemistry (primarily physics) passing along with relative smoothness but it felt like I was banging my head on a brick wall with math. This led to the vicious cycle of frustration, studying to remedy my weaknesses followed by more frustration when things didn't seem to be getting better. Despite all the apathy towards math I still managed to get through reasonably well with a consistent 2nd place in the phase tests and three digit ranks in the FIITJEE AIiTS. Unfortunately my reckless, unplanned approach towards studying in the first few months cost me greatly in other spheres of life and I was not a happy person to be around.  \\n\\nIt was around this point in time when I felt things slipping - yes, decent ranks in the phase tests were welcome but did it actually mean anything in such a sample set? There was also a storm brewing on the horizon - in the form of organic chemistry. Hard as I tried, I could never commit the material to memory. My woes with organic chem were exemplified with a jaw-dropping 11/25 in a school UT...which meant I had spent about 2 hours studying for every mark earned in that test :P  \\n\\nFortunately things slowly shaped up to look better right after 11th grade. Thanks to some quality teaching at FIITJEE and a lot time with chem textbooks organic chem started to become clearer for me. Shortly thereafter I managed to top Bangalore in FIITJEE's classroom program in the organic chem phase test. Of all the times I've had to bounce back from a tight situation in those 2 years, this was probably my highest point. Suddenly, exactly a year before IIT Advance 2015, the metaphorical glass was half full and no longer half empty. There was a calm feeling of conviction of a good possibility of me making it all the way for a 3 digit rank in IIT. Yes, my math was still well behind physics and chem but I had a year to work on it, right?  \\n\\nWell not exactly. It just so happened that 12th grade started in full flow at this point and the constant neglect I had given to the school syllabus in 11th grade was no longer feasible. I couldn't continue just scraping by the school exams with minimal preparation as I had done in 11th. It dawned on me that I would have to manage both school and FIITJEE a lot more efficiently if I had to have a chance with making it to a good college. While physics was chugging along well, math severely needed a shot in the arm and chem got a whole lot uglier with 4 (or was it 5?) full organic chapters hastily finished off in FIITJEE just days before phase test 4. The neglect with the other two subjects was all too visible with me scoring 20 marks more in physics than chem and math combined (no I'm not a savant in physics, just an idiot with math :P). In the middle of all this, a few competitive programming experiences realigned my goals with respect to computer science and I started liking it almost as much as I used to obsess with aerospace engineering in the past.  \\n\\n<a name=\\\"screwup0\\\"></a>\\nFor me, this turned into the beginning of a massive decline. For whatever reason, I succeeded in trashing both the KVPY and the NSEP - my biggest targets for 12th grade. School marks were about okay, but still less than ideal. Not in a great shape right now, huh? It proceeded to get worse when on one day in December 2014 I heard the news that because of my US citizenship, I was essentially out of the race for NITs, IIITs (note I was still in the running for IITs though) and a bunch of local colleges in Karnataka as well.  \\n\\nGodammit.  \\n\\nMy passion for physics notwithstanding I might as well not have studied at all for IIT till then. It was a pretty big blow. Fortunately, what the government taketh, they giveth. I could make it to NITs through their international program (DASA) solely through subject SAT scores which shouldn't be to big of a deal given all the study towards JEE. If you've been reading this closely, you would have probably guessed that even that wasn't exactly straightforward since the only available day to attempt the subject SAT before the deadline was December 6, exactly a week after I heard about this scheme. The subject SATs themselves were uneventful - 2400. Incidentally, at this time math finally seemed to be shaping up for the first time since I chanced upon this business with FIITJEE. I could reasonably solve problems when in the mood which was a big change from how I used to dawdle with the subject earlier.  \\n\\nLittle did I know that is was the beginning of the biggest low I experienced - school pre-boards in January 2015 was an unmitigated disaster. 55% in math and about the same in chem with similarly bad marks across the board in CSc, physics, and English made for some very unpleasant conversations with my parents. Forget about JEE, at that point, even making the 80% in boards for qualifying cutoff was looking distant. Intertwined in this was the new BITS Hyderabad international admissions program which also made use of the good subject SAT score! But the twist was that they needed SAT reasoning scores too - which left me (yet again) with no option to attempt it within a week's time after the pre-boards to make the deadline. Gave it my all - 2220 overall or 1580/1600 CR+Math. With some assurance of BITS Hyderabad, college entrance exams totally took a backseat from the beginning of this year, the primary focus from then on being the board exams.  \\n\\nIt took a lot of effort to get started - those pre-board marks were not going to fix themselves and I had to make up almost the full year's syllabus in a bit more than a month to stand a chance. Eventually, the rote-learning mode grew on me and the board exams came and went in March without too much drama. Just the day before my last board exam, BITS Hyderabad sent an offer letter for taking up CSc at an 80% scholarship! For a few sweet minutes the pressure of the last two years was off.  \\n\\n<a name=\\\"entrancexams\\\"></a>\\nIf you haven't slept off yet reading through all that, here's where it started to get interesting. Board exams done and dusted left me free to attempt the set of entrance exams at will - the main ones being JEE Mains/Advance and the BITSAT. With BITS Hyderabad CSc, I was of the opinion things could only get better as I could attempt all the exams with a free mind. This went on to be reasonably true - starting off with JEE Mains on the second Friday of April 2015 - I picked up 206/360 in JEE Mains with a solid 88/120 in physics, 83/120 in chem, and 35/120 (:P) in math. Though I would've hoped for it bit more, it turned out to be a better score than I thought it would be as the cutoffs had dropped by 10 marks from the previous year and that very few in my batch had scored higher. Much later on, it transpired that this JEE Mains score with my 95+% in CBSE would give me a decent shot at getting CSc at NIT, Surathkal campus, Aerospace Engineering at IISt, and hell, even decent choices (more so with the NTSE) at IIIT-H had it not been for my US citizenship.\\n\\nWith this Mains result in hand, it led me to a crucial decision - study for the BITSAT and go for it all to get CSc at Pilani campus? Study for JEE Advance instead to salvage a decent rank especially since BITS unifies their curriculum across campuses? I decided to go for the BITSAT - after all my math was in no condition for the brunt of JEE Advance but I had a good shot of making up to a respectable level for the BITSAT, which is an objectively much easier exam.  \\n\\n<a name=\\\"bitsat\\\"></a>\\nThis quickly turned into an obsession - with a BITSAT textbook by my side I started optimising and gaming the whole test to the minute with well divided time sections for all the subjects and strategies for almost all the possible outcomes at each stage. Math felt like it was finally on par with the other two subjects. With strong 350-370 scores after attempting all the questions in all the mock tests without the bonus 12 questions, it looked like that the dream of two years was finally within my grasp.  \\n\\nBut, for some inexplicable reason, I felt tremendous pressure just hours before the exam when I should have been getting a sound sleep. It was awful and I only managed to catch a few hours of sleep after finally going to sleep at 2am on the day of the exam scheduled at 830am.  \\n\\nThe sleep deprivation didn't augur well but that only partially sealed my fate. The invigilator gave me more rough paper than I was supposed to be given before the exam (the two rough booklets were somehow glued back to back), only to realize his mistake when I started the math section.  \\n\\n_This can't be happening_, I thought. _This isn't how it's supposed to all end._  \\n\\nMy extra rough sheets were confiscated by the proctor and then it hit me that this really was the final nail in the coffin. At that very moment the blood drained from my face realising that my chances were slipping by the second. With 90 minutes left to go but with no rough paper I was very much on the verge of giving up knowing that it really couldn't be worse. Math was never my strongest subject but attempting it without any rough paper was completely out of the question. Despite all this, I realized that I couldn't just let a dream of 2 years fall apart for such a pathetic issue and still went on with the test - guessing everything I could on the math section.  \\n\\nI went for the extra 12 questions which were fine but I knew that the damage done from fluking most of math was irreparable. With the most anxiety I've ever experienced, I clicked the \\\"Submit Test\\\" button to see how I had done.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Your score: 307\\\\***\\n\\n\\\\**It was later revised to 311; 118/43*\\n\\n**WTF**.\\n\\nSurely it was just my sleep deprived brain that was seeing things, right? I rubbed my eyes, half expecting the last two digits of the score to reverse.\\n\\nI opened my eyes again. No change. Then I glanced towards the bottom of the screen and then I knew I had truly screwed the pooch.\\n\\n**Correct: 117**\\n\\n**Incorrect: 44**\\n\\n(Correctly marked answers are worth 3 marks and incorrectly marked answers lose 1 mark from the total)  \\n\\nI stumbled out of the exam room/computer lab feeling absolutely numb. Speech was difficult without a torrent of tears.\\n\\nBITS Pilani CSc, heck, CSc at any BITS campus through BITSAT was an impossibility. It felt crushing and terrible to work so hard and to get so close only to ruin everything on the day of the exam for some issue that I had no control over. That day was not the first time I cried myself to sleep in those two years, but at least in those times there was a silver lining in getting another chance to do well in some other exam. There was no other exam left to do well in this time.  \\n\\nStrangely the only solace at the time was that I had to give JEE Advance (is it spelled Advanced? My bad if it's wrong) with absolutely no preparation due to preparing for the BITSAT instead. So, I ended up with only three days to prepare for JEE Advance and did nothing more than three previous year's papers to make sure I wasn't wasting time on any particular section and to ensure I hadn't lost too much touch.\\n\\n24 May 2015 was the day. I knew I was going to be in serious trouble before even opening the question paper - the cover page of the question paper itself indicated that the next three hours were going to be pure torture with a ridiculous +4/-2 marking scheme on multiple correct option questions (this means more than one of the given MCQ options could be correct and failing to mark all the correct options would make one lose 2 marks), +4/0 integer type (think: a free response question with values from 0-9), and +2/-1 match the following (which is a whole lot more sinister than it sounds when you realise that MORE than one option in a column can be mapped to the other and all the correct options are required to be marked). It was a blur - all I remember was being completely deflated and slightly relieved that my ordeal only had another three hours with Paper 2 which followed a very similarly brutal marking scheme. I felt like I was in with a chance after doing the 2014 and 2012 question papers but there was no way I could squeeze out a good score with this. It was a bittersweet feeling after the those long 6 hours - sweet to think that the sweat and toil of the last two years was finally over and bitter to see how everything concerning my given entrance exams had fallen apart in the last week. The first thing I did on getting home from the exam was to sit down in the garden, on the grass and slowly piece together what exactly had happened. There were no tears as there had been for making a mess of the BITSAT - just a quiet resignation and mild shock that dreams had been shattered for good.  \\n\\nCurrently, I'm stuck at the difficult decision with taking BITS Hyderabad CSc BE or trying for a dual degree program at BITS Goa, taking physics and eventually CSc.  \\n\\nWow, that's easily been the longest single piece of writing I've ever done.

I don't know if anyone still reads this blog, but I sure appreciate if you do!  \\n\\nSo, I guess some explanation is due here - it's been a combination of my lack of cohesive thought and lack of motivation to publish anything. Part of the reason is also that I've given a shot at the IIT-JEE which is something that I've wanted to write about for a while.  \\n\\nFor the uninitiated, the IIT-JEE is an entrance exam for the IITs which are regarded by some as the best engineering colleges in India. The exam is held at the end of 12th grade annually. Hundreds of thousands attempt the exam. Tens of thousands slog away countless hours of their last few years in high school preparing for it. Only a few hundred actually succeed.  \\n\\nLike many with some strong aspirations of becoming an engineer, I stumbled upon this path a couple of years ago. I loved making/breaking things and had (what I felt) a keen interest in science, so it was a natural option for me to take some engineering related field over other options. I loved airplanes too and I would spend many happy hours on Wikipedia reading up about the Concorde (gorgeous plane), the XB-70, their engines, their airframe designs, and the engineers behind it all. I was fiercely determined to enter the aviation industry as an aerospace engineer to create a revolutionary aircraft on the lines of the Concorde.\\n\\nIt's an unspoken reality that one's chances at IIT-JEE significantly decrease without the assistance of extra classes outside school, also known as coaching classes. I joined one at the start of the summer vacation prior to 11th called FIITJEE after getting a decent fee waiver via their admission test. I was no stranger to horror stories of 11th and 12th grade for school students, but I felt things would change for the better after the brain-numbing syllabus of 10th grade.  \\n\\nAnd it did. To an extent. Things passed very quickly through the first few months of FIITJEE where I was tirelessly trying to understand every fragment of information that would probably help in making it through with a good rank in IIT Advance. My math wasn't strongest to begin with and I trudged along with chem with ambivalence to the subject material. Studying physics, both in class and at home was amazing. Thanks to our FIITJEE physics teacher, one of the best teachers I've ever had, physics by acompared long shot became my favorite subject for the next two years. It always just clicked and moreover studying physics and learning something new to solve an interesting problem was just _fun_. I remember physics and chemistry (primarily physics) passing along with relative smoothness but it felt like I was banging my head on a brick wall with math. This led to the vicious cycle of frustration, studying to remedy my weaknesses followed by more frustration when things didn't seem to be getting better. Despite all the apathy towards math I still managed to get through reasonably well with a consistent 2nd place in the phase tests and three digit ranks in the FIITJEE AIiTS. Unfortunately my reckless, unplanned approach towards studying in the first few months cost me greatly in other spheres of life and I was not a happy person to be around.  \\n\\nIt was around this point in time when I felt things slipping - yes, decent ranks in the phase tests were welcome but did it actually mean anything in such a sample set? There was also a storm brewing on the horizon - in the form of organic chemistry. Hard as I tried, I could never commit the material to memory. My woes with organic chem were exemplified with a jaw-dropping 11/25 in a school UT...which meant I had spent about 2 hours studying for every mark earned in that test :P  \\n\\nFortunately things slowly shaped up to look better right after 11th grade. Thanks to some quality teaching at FIITJEE and a lot time with chem textbooks organic chem started to become clearer for me. Shortly thereafter I managed to top Bangalore in FIITJEE's classroom program in the organic chem phase test. Of all the times I've had to bounce back from a tight situation in those 2 years, this was probably my highest point. Suddenly, exactly a year before IIT Advance 2015, the metaphorical glass was half full and no longer half empty. There was a calm feeling of conviction of a good possibility of me making it all the way for a 3 digit rank in IIT. Yes, my math was still well behind physics and chem but I had a year to work on it, right?  \\n\\nWell not exactly. It just so happened that 12th grade started in full flow at this point and the constant neglect I had given to the school syllabus in 11th grade was no longer feasible. I couldn't continue just scraping by the school exams with minimal preparation as I had done in 11th. It dawned on me that I would have to manage both school and FIITJEE a lot more efficiently if I had to have a chance with making it to a good college. While physics was chugging along well, math severely needed a shot in the arm and chem got a whole lot uglier with 4 (or was it 5?) full organic chapters hastily finished off in FIITJEE just days before phase test 4. The neglect with the other two subjects was all too visible with me scoring 20 marks more in physics than chem and math combined (no I'm not a savant in physics, just an idiot with math :P). In the middle of all this, a few competitive programming experiences realigned my goals with respect to computer science and I started liking it almost as much as I used to obsess with aerospace engineering in the past.  \\n\\n<a name=\\\"screwup0\\\"></a>\\nFor me, this turned into the beginning of a massive decline. For whatever reason, I succeeded in trashing both the KVPY and the NSEP - my biggest targets for 12th grade. School marks were about okay, but still less than ideal. Not in a great shape right now, huh? It proceeded to get worse when on one day in December 2014 I heard the news that because of my US citizenship, I was essentially out of the race for NITs, IIITs (note I was still in the running for IITs though) and a bunch of local colleges in Karnataka as well.  \\n\\nGodammit.  \\n\\nMy passion for physics notwithstanding I might as well not have studied at all for IIT till then. It was a pretty big blow. Fortunately, what the government taketh, they giveth. I could make it to NITs through their international program (DASA) solely through subject SAT scores which shouldn't be to big of a deal given all the study towards JEE. If you've been reading this closely, you would have probably guessed that even that wasn't exactly straightforward since the only available day to attempt the subject SAT before the deadline was December 6, exactly a week after I heard about this scheme. The subject SATs themselves were uneventful - 2400. Incidentally, at this time math finally seemed to be shaping up for the first time since I chanced upon this business with FIITJEE. I could reasonably solve problems when in the mood which was a big change from how I used to dawdle with the subject earlier.  \\n\\nLittle did I know that is was the beginning of the biggest low I experienced - school pre-boards in January 2015 was an unmitigated disaster. 55% in math and about the same in chem with similarly bad marks across the board in CSc, physics, and English made for some very unpleasant conversations with my parents. Forget about JEE, at that point, even making the 80% in boards for qualifying cutoff was looking distant. Intertwined in this was the new BITS Hyderabad international admissions program which also made use of the good subject SAT score! But the twist was that they needed SAT reasoning scores too - which left me (yet again) with no option to attempt it within a week's time after the pre-boards to make the deadline. Gave it my all - 2220 overall or 1580/1600 CR+Math. With some assurance of BITS Hyderabad, college entrance exams totally took a backseat from the beginning of this year, the primary focus from then on being the board exams.  \\n\\nIt took a lot of effort to get started - those pre-board marks were not going to fix themselves and I had to make up almost the full year's syllabus in a bit more than a month to stand a chance. Eventually, the rote-learning mode grew on me and the board exams came and went in March without too much drama. Just the day before my last board exam, BITS Hyderabad sent an offer letter for taking up CSc at an 80% scholarship! For a few sweet minutes the pressure of the last two years was off.  \\n\\n<a name=\\\"entrancexams\\\"></a>\\nIf you haven't slept off yet reading through all that, here's where it started to get interesting. Board exams done and dusted left me free to attempt the set of entrance exams at will - the main ones being JEE Mains/Advance and the BITSAT. With BITS Hyderabad CSc, I was of the opinion things could only get better as I could attempt all the exams with a free mind. This went on to be reasonably true - starting off with JEE Mains on the second Friday of April 2015 - I picked up 206/360 in JEE Mains with a solid 88/120 in physics, 83/120 in chem, and 35/120 (:P) in math. Though I would've hoped for it bit more, it turned out to be a better score than I thought it would be as the cutoffs had dropped by 10 marks from the previous year and that very few in my batch had scored higher. Much later on, it transpired that this JEE Mains score with my 95+% in CBSE would give me a decent shot at getting CSc at NIT, Surathkal campus, Aerospace Engineering at IISt, and hell, even decent choices (more so with the NTSE) at IIIT-H had it not been for my US citizenship.\\n\\nWith this Mains result in hand, it led me to a crucial decision - study for the BITSAT and go for it all to get CSc at Pilani campus?

I was no stranger to horror stories of 11th and 12th grade for school students, but I felt things would change for the better after the brain-numbing syllabus of 10th grade.  \\n\\nAnd it did. To an extent. Things passed very quickly through the first few months of FIITJEE where I was tirelessly trying to understand every fragment of information that would probably help in making it through with a good rank in IIT Advance. My math wasn't strongest to begin with and I trudged along with chem with ambivalence to the subject material. Studying physics, both in class and at home was amazing. Thanks to our FIITJEE physics teacher, one of the best teachers I've ever had, physics by acompared long shot became my favorite subject for the next two years. It always just clicked and moreover studying physics and learning something new to solve an interesting problem was just _fun_. I remember physics and chemistry (primarily physics) passing along with relative smoothness but it felt like I was banging my head on a brick wall with math. This led to the vicious cycle of frustration, studying to remedy my weaknesses followed by more frustration when things didn't seem to be getting better. Despite all the apathy towards math I still managed to get through reasonably well with a consistent 2nd place in the phase tests and three digit ranks in the FIITJEE AIiTS. Unfortunately my reckless, unplanned approach towards studying in the first few months cost me greatly in other spheres of life and I was not a happy person to be around.  \\n\\nIt was around this point in time when I felt things slipping - yes, decent ranks in the phase tests were welcome but did it actually mean anything in such a sample set? There was also a storm brewing on the horizon - in the form of organic chemistry. Hard as I tried, I could never commit the material to memory. My woes with organic chem were exemplified with a jaw-dropping 11/25 in a school UT...which meant I had spent about 2 hours studying for every mark earned in that test :P  \\n\\nFortunately things slowly shaped up to look better right after 11th grade. Thanks to some quality teaching at FIITJEE and a lot time with chem textbooks organic chem started to become clearer for me. Shortly thereafter I managed to top Bangalore in FIITJEE's classroom program in the organic chem phase test. Of all the times I've had to bounce back from a tight situation in those 2 years, this was probably my highest point. Suddenly, exactly a year before IIT Advance 2015, the metaphorical glass was half full and no longer half empty. There was a calm feeling of conviction of a good possibility of me making it all the way for a 3 digit rank in IIT. Yes, my math was still well behind physics and chem but I had a year to work on it, right?  \\n\\nWell not exactly. It just so happened that 12th grade started in full flow at this point and the constant neglect I had given to the school syllabus in 11th grade was no longer feasible. I couldn't continue just scraping by the school exams with minimal preparation as I had done in 11th. It dawned on me that I would have to manage both school and FIITJEE a lot more efficiently if I had to have a chance with making it to a good college. While physics was chugging along well, math severely needed a shot in the arm and chem got a whole lot uglier with 4 (or was it 5?) full organic chapters hastily finished off in FIITJEE just days before phase test 4. The neglect with the other two subjects was all too visible with me scoring 20 marks more in physics than chem and math combined (no I'm not a savant in physics, just an idiot with math :P). In the middle of all this, a few competitive programming experiences realigned my goals with respect to computer science and I started liking it almost as much as I used to obsess with aerospace engineering in the past.  \\n\\n<a name=\\\"screwup0\\\"></a>\\nFor me, this turned into the beginning of a massive decline. For whatever reason, I succeeded in trashing both the KVPY and the NSEP - my biggest targets for 12th grade. School marks were about okay, but still less than ideal. Not in a great shape right now, huh? It proceeded to get worse when on one day in December 2014 I heard the news that because of my US citizenship, I was essentially out of the race for NITs, IIITs (note I was still in the running for IITs though) and a bunch of local colleges in Karnataka as well.  \\n\\nGodammit.  \\n\\nMy passion for physics notwithstanding I might as well not have studied at all for IIT till then. It was a pretty big blow. Fortunately, what the government taketh, they giveth. I could make it to NITs through their international program (DASA) solely through subject SAT scores which shouldn't be to big of a deal given all the study towards JEE. If you've been reading this closely, you would have probably guessed that even that wasn't exactly straightforward since the only available day to attempt the subject SAT before the deadline was December 6, exactly a week after I heard about this scheme. The subject SATs themselves were uneventful - 2400. Incidentally, at this time math finally seemed to be shaping up for the first time since I chanced upon this business with FIITJEE. I could reasonably solve problems when in the mood which was a big change from how I used to dawdle with the subject earlier.  \\n\\nLittle did I know that is was the beginning of the biggest low I experienced - school pre-boards in January 2015 was an unmitigated disaster. 55% in math and about the same in chem with similarly bad marks across the board in CSc, physics, and English made for some very unpleasant conversations with my parents. Forget about JEE, at that point, even making the 80% in boards for qualifying cutoff was looking distant. Intertwined in this was the new BITS Hyderabad international admissions program which also made use of the good subject SAT score! But the twist was that they needed SAT reasoning scores too - which left me (yet again) with no option to attempt it within a week's time after the pre-boards to make the deadline. Gave it my all - 2220 overall or 1580/1600 CR+Math. With some assurance of BITS Hyderabad, college entrance exams totally took a backseat from the beginning of this year, the primary focus from then on being the board exams.  \\n\\nIt took a lot of effort to get started - those pre-board marks were not going to fix themselves and I had to make up almost the full year's syllabus in a bit more than a month to stand a chance. Eventually, the rote-learning mode grew on me and the board exams came and went in March without too much drama. Just the day before my last board exam, BITS Hyderabad sent an offer letter for taking up CSc at an 80% scholarship! For a few sweet minutes the pressure of the last two years was off.  \\n\\n<a name=\\\"entrancexams\\\"></a>\\nIf you haven't slept off yet reading through all that, here's where it started to get interesting. Board exams done and dusted left me free to attempt the set of entrance exams at will - the main ones being JEE Mains/Advance and the BITSAT. With BITS Hyderabad CSc, I was of the opinion things could only get better as I could attempt all the exams with a free mind. This went on to be reasonably true - starting off with JEE Mains on the second Friday of April 2015 - I picked up 206/360 in JEE Mains with a solid 88/120 in physics, 83/120 in chem, and 35/120 (:P) in math. Though I would've hoped for it bit more, it turned out to be a better score than I thought it would be as the cutoffs had dropped by 10 marks from the previous year and that very few in my batch had scored higher. Much later on, it transpired that this JEE Mains score with my 95+% in CBSE would give me a decent shot at getting CSc at NIT, Surathkal campus, Aerospace Engineering at IISt, and hell, even decent choices (more so with the NTSE) at IIIT-H had it not been for my US citizenship.\\n\\nWith this Mains result in hand, it led me to a crucial decision - study for the BITSAT and go for it all to get CSc at Pilani campus? Study for JEE Advance instead to salvage a decent rank especially since BITS unifies their curriculum across campuses? I decided to go for the BITSAT - after all my math was in no condition for the brunt of JEE Advance but I had a good shot of making up to a respectable level for the BITSAT, which is an objectively much easier exam.  \\n\\n<a name=\\\"bitsat\\\"></a>\\nThis quickly turned into an obsession - with a BITSAT textbook by my side I started optimising and gaming the whole test to the minute with well divided time sections for all the subjects and strategies for almost all the possible outcomes at each stage. Math felt like it was finally on par with the other two subjects. With strong 350-370 scores after attempting all the questions in all the mock tests without the bonus 12 questions, it looked like that the dream of two years was finally within my grasp.  \\n\\nBut, for some inexplicable reason, I felt tremendous pressure just hours before the exam when I should have been getting a sound sleep. It was awful and I only managed to catch a few hours of sleep after finally going to sleep at 2am on the day of the exam scheduled at 830am.  \\n\\nThe sleep deprivation didn't augur well but that only partially sealed my fate. The invigilator gave me more rough paper than I was supposed to be given before the exam (the two rough booklets were somehow glued back to back), only to realize his mistake when I started the math section.  \\n\\n_This can't be happening_, I thought. _This isn't how it's supposed to all end._  \\n\\nMy extra rough sheets were confiscated by the proctor and then it hit me that this really was the final nail in the coffin. At that very moment the blood drained from my face realising that my chances were slipping by the second. With 90 minutes left to go but with no rough paper I was very much on the verge of giving up knowing that it really couldn't be worse. Math was never my strongest subject but attempting it without any rough paper was completely out of the question. Despite all this, I realized that I couldn't just let a dream of 2 years fall apart for such a pathetic issue and still went on with the test - guessing everything I could on the math section.  \\n\\nI went for the extra 12 questions which were fine but I knew that the damage done from fluking most of math was irreparable. With the most anxiety I've ever experienced, I clicked the \\\"Submit Test\\\" button to see how I had done.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Your score: 307\\\\***\\n\\n\\\\**It was later revised to 311; 118/43*\\n\\n**WTF**.\\n\\nSurely it was just my sleep deprived brain that was seeing things, right? I rubbed my eyes, half expecting the last two digits of the score to reverse.\\n\\nI opened my eyes again. No change. Then I glanced towards the bottom of the screen and then I knew I had truly screwed the pooch.\\n\\n**Correct: 117**\\n\\n**Incorrect: 44**\\n\\n(Correctly marked answers are worth 3 marks and incorrectly marked answers lose 1 mark from the total)  \\n\\nI stumbled out of the exam room/computer lab feeling absolutely numb. Speech was difficult without a torrent of tears.\\n\\nBITS Pilani CSc, heck, CSc at any BITS campus through BITSAT was an impossibility. It felt crushing and terrible to work so hard and to get so close only to ruin everything on the day of the exam for some issue that I had no control over. That day was not the first time I cried myself to sleep in those two years, but at least in those times there was a silver lining in getting another chance to do well in some other exam. There was no other exam left to do well in this time.  \\n\\nStrangely the only solace at the time was that I had to give JEE Advance (is it spelled Advanced? My bad if it's wrong) with absolutely no preparation due to preparing for the BITSAT instead. So, I ended up with only three days to prepare for JEE Advance and did nothing more than three previous year's papers to make sure I wasn't wasting time on any particular section and to ensure I hadn't lost too much touch.\\n\\n24 May 2015 was the day. I knew I was going to be in serious trouble before even opening the question paper - the cover page of the question paper itself indicated that the next three hours were going to be pure torture with a ridiculous +4/-2 marking scheme on multiple correct option questions (this means more than one of the given MCQ options could be correct and failing to mark all the correct options would make one lose 2 marks), +4/0 integer type (think: a free response question with values from 0-9), and +2/-1 match the following (which is a whole lot more sinister than it sounds when you realise that MORE than one option in a column can be mapped to the other and all the correct options are required to be marked). It was a blur - all I remember was being completely deflated and slightly relieved that my ordeal only had another three hours with Paper 2 which followed a very similarly brutal marking scheme. I felt like I was in with a chance after doing the 2014 and 2012 question papers but there was no way I could squeeze out a good score with this. It was a bittersweet feeling after the those long 6 hours - sweet to think that the sweat and toil of the last two years was finally over and bitter to see how everything concerning my given entrance exams had fallen apart in the last week. The first thing I did on getting home from the exam was to sit down in the garden, on the grass and slowly piece together what exactly had happened. There were no tears as there had been for making a mess of the BITSAT - just a quiet resignation and mild shock that dreams had been shattered for good.  \\n\\nCurrently, I'm stuck at the difficult decision with taking BITS Hyderabad CSc BE or trying for a dual degree program at BITS Goa, taking physics and eventually CSc.  \\n\\nWow, that's easily been the longest single piece of writing I've ever done. I typed most of it on my phone on the plane, so apologies if it doesn't make too much sense. If you've made it all the way here, thanks for reading!\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","page":false,"published_at":"2015-06-17T04:59:00.000Z","slug":"t-2-years-and-counting-my-iit-jee-preparation-story","status":"draft","title":"T+2 Years And Counting: My IIT-JEE preparation story","updated_at":"2018-08-13T18:52:40.000Z","authors":{"0":{"id":"1","name":"arnav dhamija","slug":"arnav","email":"arnav.dhamija@gmail.com","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"accessibility":"{\"nightShift\":true}","status":"active","locale":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"last_seen":{},"created_at":{},"updated_at":{},"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\",\"upload-a-theme\",\"using-the-editor\"]"}},"tags":{}}}},"query":{"include":"authors,tags,authors.roles"}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"no-cache, private, no-store, must-revalidate, max-stale=0, post-check=0, pre-check=0","x-cache-invalidate":"/p/a8b32169-7e2e-4aee-97ac-e3cf727facf1/","content-type":"application/json; charset=utf-8","etag":"W/\"4854-uBFD8XP8dDHbF7qrwrtBOIjaxSg\"","vary":"Accept-Encoding","content-encoding":"gzip"},"statusCode":200,"responseTime":"209ms"},"msg":"","time":"2018-08-13T18:53:04.860Z","v":0}

Part of the reason is also that I've given a shot at the IIT-JEE which is something that I've wanted to write about for a while.  \\n\\nFor the uninitiated, the IIT-JEE is an entrance exam for the IITs which are regarded by some as the best engineering colleges in India.

Only a few hundred actually succeed.  \\n\\nLike many with some strong aspirations of becoming an engineer, I stumbled upon this path a couple of years ago. I loved making/breaking things and had (what I felt) a keen interest in science, so it was a natural option for me to take some engineering related field over other options.

With 90 minutes left to go but with no rough paper I was very much on the verge of giving up knowing that it really couldn't be worse. Math was never my strongest subject but attempting it without any rough paper was completely out of the question. Despite all this, I realized that I couldn't just let a dream of 2 years fall apart for such a pathetic issue and still went on with the test - guessing everything I could on the math section.  \\n\\nI went for the extra 12 questions which were fine but I knew that the damage done from fluking most of math was irreparable. With the most anxiety I've ever experienced, I clicked the \\\"Submit Test\\\" button to see how I had done.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Your score: 307\\\\***\\n\\n\\\\**It was later revised to 311; 118/43*\\n\\n**WTF**.\\n\\nSurely it was just my sleep deprived brain that was seeing things, right? I rubbed my eyes, half expecting the last two digits of the score to reverse.\\n\\nI opened my eyes again. No change. Then I glanced towards the bottom of the screen and then I knew I had truly screwed the pooch.\\n\\n**Correct: 117**\\n\\n**Incorrect: 44**\\n\\n(Correctly marked answers are worth 3 marks and incorrectly marked answers lose 1 mark from the total)  \\n\\nI stumbled out of the exam room/computer lab feeling absolutely numb. Speech was difficult without a torrent of tears.\\n\\nBITS Pilani CSc, heck, CSc at any BITS campus through BITSAT was an impossibility. It felt crushing and terrible to work so hard and to get so close only to ruin everything on the day of the exam for some issue that I had no control over. That day was not the first time I cried myself to sleep in those two years, but at least in those times there was a silver lining in getting another chance to do well in some other exam. There was no other exam left to do well in this time.  \\n\\nStrangely the only solace at the time was that I had to give JEE Advance (is it spelled Advanced? My bad if it's wrong) with absolutely no preparation due to preparing for the BITSAT instead. So, I ended up with only three days to prepare for JEE Advance and did nothing more than three previous year's papers to make sure I wasn't wasting time on any particular section and to ensure I hadn't lost too much touch.\\n\\n24 May 2015 was the day. I knew I was going to be in serious trouble before even opening the question paper - the cover page of the question paper itself indicated that the next three hours were going to be pure torture with a ridiculous +4/-2 marking scheme on multiple correct option questions (this means more than one of the given MCQ options could be correct and failing to mark all the correct options would make one lose 2 marks), +4/0 integer type (think: a free response question with values from 0-9), and +2/-1 match the following (which is a whole lot more sinister than it sounds when you realise that MORE than one option in a column can be mapped to the other and all the correct options are required to be marked). It was a blur - all I remember was being completely deflated and slightly relieved that my ordeal only had another three hours with Paper 2 which followed a very similarly brutal marking scheme. I felt like I was in with a chance after doing the 2014 and 2012 question papers but there was no way I could squeeze out a good score with this. It was a bittersweet feeling after the those long 6 hours - sweet to think that the sweat and toil of the last two years was finally over and bitter to see how everything concerning my given entrance exams had fallen apart in the last week. The first thing I did on getting home from the exam was to sit down in the garden, on the grass and slowly piece together what exactly had happened. There were no tears as there had been for making a mess of the BITSAT - just a quiet resignation and mild shock that dreams had been shattered for good.  \\n\\nCurrently, I'm stuck at the difficult decision with taking BITS Hyderabad CSc BE or trying for a dual degree program at BITS Goa, taking physics and eventually CSc.  \\n\\nWow, that's easily been the longest single piece of writing I've ever done. I typed most of it on my phone on the plane, so apologies if it doesn't make too much sense.

I don't know if anyone still reads this blog, but I sure appreciate if you do!  \\n\\nSo, I guess some explanation is due here - it's been a combination of my lack of cohesive thought and lack of motivation to publish anything. Part of the reason is also that I've given a shot at the IIT-JEE which is something that I've wanted to write about for a while.  \\n\\nFor the uninitiated, the IIT-JEE is an entrance exam for the IITs which are regarded by some as the best engineering colleges in India. The exam is held at the end of 12th grade annually. Hundreds of thousands attempt the exam. Tens of thousands slog away countless hours of their last few years in high school preparing for it. Only a few hundred actually succeed.  \\n\\nLike many with some strong aspirations of becoming an engineer, I stumbled upon this path a couple of years ago. I loved making/breaking things and had (what I felt) a keen interest in science, so it was a natural option for me to take some engineering related field over other options. I loved airplanes too and I would spend many happy hours on Wikipedia reading up about the Concorde (gorgeous plane), the XB-70, their engines, their airframe designs, and the engineers behind it all. I was fiercely determined to enter the aviation industry as an aerospace engineer to create a revolutionary aircraft on the lines of the Concorde.\\n\\nIt's an unspoken reality that one's chances at IIT-JEE significantly decrease without the assistance of extra classes outside school, also known as coaching classes. I joined one at the start of the summer vacation prior to 11th called FIITJEE after getting a decent fee waiver via their admission test. I was no stranger to horror stories of 11th and 12th grade for school students, but I felt things would change for the better after the brain-numbing syllabus of 10th grade.  \\n\\nAnd it did. To an extent. Things passed very quickly through the first few months of FIITJEE where I was tirelessly trying to understand every fragment of information that would probably help in making it through with a good rank in IIT Advance. My math wasn't strongest to begin with and I trudged along with chem with ambivalence to the subject material. Studying physics, both in class and at home was amazing. Thanks to our FIITJEE physics teacher, one of the best teachers I've ever had, physics by acompared long shot became my favorite subject for the next two years. It always just clicked and moreover studying physics and learning something new to solve an interesting problem was just _fun_. I remember physics and chemistry (primarily physics) passing along with relative smoothness but it felt like I was banging my head on a brick wall with math. This led to the vicious cycle of frustration, studying to remedy my weaknesses followed by more frustration when things didn't seem to be getting better. Despite all the apathy towards math I still managed to get through reasonably well with a consistent 2nd place in the phase tests and three digit ranks in the FIITJEE AIiTS. Unfortunately my reckless, unplanned approach towards studying in the first few months cost me greatly in other spheres of life and I was not a happy person to be around.  \\n\\nIt was around this point in time when I felt things slipping - yes, decent ranks in the phase tests were welcome but did it actually mean anything in such a sample set? There was also a storm brewing on the horizon - in the form of organic chemistry. Hard as I tried, I could never commit the material to memory. My woes with organic chem were exemplified with a jaw-dropping 11/25 in a school UT...which meant I had spent about 2 hours studying for every mark earned in that test :P  \\n\\nFortunately things slowly shaped up to look better right after 11th grade. Thanks to some quality teaching at FIITJEE and a lot time with chem textbooks organic chem started to become clearer for me. Shortly thereafter I managed to top Bangalore in FIITJEE's classroom program in the organic chem phase test. Of all the times I've had to bounce back from a tight situation in those 2 years, this was probably my highest point. Suddenly, exactly a year before IIT Advance 2015, the metaphorical glass was half full and no longer half empty. There was a calm feeling of conviction of a good possibility of me making it all the way for a 3 digit rank in IIT. Yes, my math was still well behind physics and chem but I had a year to work on it, right?  \\n\\nWell not exactly. It just so happened that 12th grade started in full flow at this point and the constant neglect I had given to the school syllabus in 11th grade was no longer feasible. I couldn't continue just scraping by the school exams with minimal preparation as I had done in 11th. It dawned on me that I would have to manage both school and FIITJEE a lot more efficiently if I had to have a chance with making it to a good college. While physics was chugging along well, math severely needed a shot in the arm and chem got a whole lot uglier with 4 (or was it 5?) full organic chapters hastily finished off in FIITJEE just days before phase test 4. The neglect with the other two subjects was all too visible with me scoring 20 marks more in physics than chem and math combined (no I'm not a savant in physics, just an idiot with math :P). In the middle of all this, a few competitive programming experiences realigned my goals with respect to computer science and I started liking it almost as much as I used to obsess with aerospace engineering in the past.  \\n\\n<a name=\\\"screwup0\\\"></a>\\nFor me, this turned into the beginning of a massive decline. For whatever reason, I succeeded in trashing both the KVPY and the NSEP - my biggest targets for 12th grade. School marks were about okay, but still less than ideal. Not in a great shape right now, huh? It proceeded to get worse when on one day in December 2014 I heard the news that because of my US citizenship, I was essentially out of the race for NITs, IIITs (note I was still in the running for IITs though) and a bunch of local colleges in Karnataka as well.  \\n\\nGodammit.  \\n\\nMy passion for physics notwithstanding I might as well not have studied at all for IIT till then. It was a pretty big blow. Fortunately, what the government taketh, they giveth. I could make it to NITs through their international program (DASA) solely through subject SAT scores which shouldn't be to big of a deal given all the study towards JEE. If you've been reading this closely, you would have probably guessed that even that wasn't exactly straightforward since the only available day to attempt the subject SAT before the deadline was December 6, exactly a week after I heard about this scheme. The subject SATs themselves were uneventful - 2400. Incidentally, at this time math finally seemed to be shaping up for the first time since I chanced upon this business with FIITJEE. I could reasonably solve problems when in the mood which was a big change from how I used to dawdle with the subject earlier.  \\n\\nLittle did I know that is was the beginning of the biggest low I experienced - school pre-boards in January 2015 was an unmitigated disaster. 55% in math and about the same in chem with similarly bad marks across the board in CSc, physics, and English made for some very unpleasant conversations with my parents. Forget about JEE, at that point, even making the 80% in boards for qualifying cutoff was looking distant. Intertwined in this was the new BITS Hyderabad international admissions program which also made use of the good subject SAT score! But the twist was that they needed SAT reasoning scores too - which left me (yet again) with no option to attempt it within a week's time after the pre-boards to make the deadline. Gave it my all - 2220 overall or 1580/1600 CR+Math. With some assurance of BITS Hyderabad, college entrance exams totally took a backseat from the beginning of this year, the primary focus from then on being the board exams.  \\n\\nIt took a lot of effort to get started - those pre-board marks were not going to fix themselves and I had to make up almost the full year's syllabus in a bit more than a month to stand a chance. Eventually, the rote-learning mode grew on me and the board exams came and went in March without too much drama. Just the day before my last board exam, BITS Hyderabad sent an offer letter for taking up CSc at an 80% scholarship! For a few sweet minutes the pressure of the last two years was off.  \\n\\n<a name=\\\"entrancexams\\\"></a>\\nIf you haven't slept off yet reading through all that, here's where it started to get interesting. Board exams done and dusted left me free to attempt the set of entrance exams at will - the main ones being JEE Mains/Advance and the BITSAT. With BITS Hyderabad CSc, I was of the opinion things could only get better as I could attempt all the exams with a free mind. This went on to be reasonably true - starting off with JEE Mains on the second Friday of April 2015 - I picked up 206/360 in JEE Mains with a solid 88/120 in physics, 83/120 in chem, and 35/120 (:P) in math. Though I would've hoped for it bit more, it turned out to be a better score than I thought it would be as the cutoffs had dropped by 10 marks from the previous year and that very few in my batch had scored higher. Much later on, it transpired that this JEE Mains score with my 95+% in CBSE would give me a decent shot at getting CSc at NIT, Surathkal campus, Aerospace Engineering at IISt, and hell, even decent choices (more so with the NTSE) at IIIT-H had it not been for my US citizenship.\\n\\nWith this Mains result in hand, it led me to a crucial decision - study for the BITSAT and go for it all to get CSc at Pilani campus? Study for JEE Advance instead to salvage a decent rank especially since BITS unifies their curriculum across campuses? I decided to go for the BITSAT - after all my math was in no condition for the brunt of JEE Advance but I had a good shot of making up to a respectable level for the BITSAT, which is an objectively much easier exam.  \\n\\n<a name=\\\"bitsat\\\"></a>\\nThis quickly turned into an obsession - with a BITSAT textbook by my side I started optimising and gaming the whole test to the minute with well divided time sections for all the subjects and strategies for almost all the possible outcomes at each stage. Math felt like it was finally on par with the other two subjects. With strong 350-370 scores after attempting all the questions in all the mock tests without the bonus 12 questions, it looked like that the dream of two years was finally within my grasp.  \\n\\nBut, for some inexplicable reason, I felt tremendous pressure just hours before the exam when I should have been getting a sound sleep. It was awful and I only managed to catch a few hours of sleep after finally going to sleep at 2am on the day of the exam scheduled at 830am.  \\n\\nThe sleep deprivation didn't augur well but that only partially sealed my fate. The invigilator gave me more rough paper than I was supposed to be given before the exam (the two rough booklets were somehow glued back to back), only to realize his mistake when I started the math section.  \\n\\n_This can't be happening_, I thought. _This isn't how it's supposed to all end._  \\n\\nMy extra rough sheets were confiscated by the proctor and then it hit me that this really was the final nail in the coffin.

The Blogger theme which I was using appealled to me as 13 year old (heck, it still appeals to me), but it was growing long in the tooth and only had basic support for responsive design and mobile devices.

At first, it seemed like my search for a new blogging platform would stop here. Open-sourced, a great browser editor, a cohesive Android app, direct editing in Markdown, local installation for testing, and support for plugins made WordPress everything Blogger wasn't. I loved the number of themes and customisation WordPress provided. But the love was short lived, and it ended when I started researching hosting options for WordPress. Most solutions required me to rent a web-server on a monthly basis and I had no idea what tier of server to get as my blog had only recently seen a huge surge in pageviews. Not to mention, the cost of maintaining a website with such a setup was by no means cheap. This is when I started asking to my geeky friends about how they maintained their own personal websites.\\n\\nThe talks were very helpful, it made me realise that a dynamic blogging solution such as WordPress was overkill for a humble blog of less than 30 published posts like this one. Having a static site made so much more sense. I could write directly in Markdown, in the text editor of *my* choice. Not to mention, it made the workflow of writing a blog post just like I wrote code, `make`, `git commit`, and `git push` straight to GitHub Pages. GitHub Pages, by the way, offers completely *free* hosting for static sites. This means that the only thing I would need to pay for would be the custom domain name, a nominal ₹700 ($10) a year, an amount half of what I would be paying for a month of paid hosting. Plus, it would let me get my hands dirty with a bit of web development, something which I had pushed back for a long time.\\n\\nI decided to start this - what I knew was going to be painful task at about 11pm on a night I just knew I wouldn't be able to sleep.\\n\\nThe first step was to convert all my Blogger posts to Markdown. There were some tools online but all of them messed up the conversion pretty badly. After some more digging, I ended up using Aaron Swartz's [html2text](https://github.com/aaronsw/html2text) Python library which did a better job than other solutions in generating some useful Markdown. I still needed to edit every generated Markdown file by hand to make it something I would be happy with using on my site. I then had to export all the images I had on my Blogger site. This lead to a few more laborious hours of saving each image on the site by hand (Right Click -> View as Image -> Save As). It did cross my mind to automate everything with a script, but it was going to take more time to automate everything and check if the automation was working than it was to do the grunt work of pulling the images. With all the resources safely on my laptop and backed on my Dropbox, I took the next step of looking at static site generators to convert my lovingly handmade Markdown files to HTML.\\n\\nGitHub Pages seemed to heavily advocate [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) so I went with it first. With some tinkering to get the Ruby dependencies installed and posts adapted for Jekyll with the Front Matter content, I managed to get a pretty presentable blog running on localhost:4000/ at 5am on that day. With a quick push to my [github.io](http://shortstheory.github.com/) site, I decided to call it a night and slept off a sleep-deprived session of hacking.\\n\\nThe next few days I played with some more Jekyll themes and found that there were many things I didn't like about it. For one thing, it was written in Ruby which I have no experience with. Themes didn't look easy to work with and there was no native support for tags (there is a workaround for this, but due to my lack of Ruby-fu, it all looked terribly arcane to me). I then put the blog migration on the back burner for a while to work on projects at my college's Automation & Robotics Club.\\n\\nA few weeks later, I took a look at the blog project with some new perspective. I started by poking around for alternatives to Jekyll. There was one such alternative which ticked all my boxes - a static site generator called [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/). As WordPress looked inherently superior to Blogger, Pelican looked inherently superior to Jekyll for what I wanted to do with it. For example, it had built-in support for tags, had a theming engine, supported Markdown *and* reStructuredText, and had several easy to install plugins. Above all, Pelican is written in Python which made it so much easier for me to mess around with it. There were some more modifications to make to the Markdown files (particularly with the post metadata), but it was so trivial that it didn't pain one bit to modify all the files. Not too long after I settled on Pelican, I found a theme which made my blog look exactly how I wanted it to look. The [Pure Single](https://github.com/PurePelicanTheme) theme also has nifty support for custom sidebar images, which I used on some select [blog]({filename}/2015-06-17-t2-years-and-counting-iit-jee.md) [posts]({filename}/2016-08-30-gsoc-report-wrapping-up-gsoc-2016.md).\\n\\nThere was some initial trouble with setting a blog subfolder in the site and getting images to work on some auto-generated sites (such as the Tags and Categories pages). It later turned out that it was some problem with localhost/ not finding the paths correctly to the images and the site was totally fine when published to the GitHub Pages site. After only three days of using Pelican, I had something which I was willing to show off. The next step was much more straightforward for a change - registering a domain name. I looked into a few options such as GoDaddy, Hover, and Namecheap. Namecheap had positive reviews (unlike GoDaddy) and was the cheapest of the lot. The site configuration to serve pages from GitHub's servers was not more than a 10 minute procedure, and I finally had the site you are reading this article on right now.\\n\\nThere will be a lot more changes coming up on this blog, some of them aesthetic and some functional. I'm also probably going to change the name of this blog sometime soon, to something which is more reflective of my current sensibilities.\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","page":false,"slug":"untitled","status":"draft","title":"(Untitled)","authors":{"0":{"id":"1","name":"arnav dhamija","slug":"arnav","email":"arnav.dhamija@gmail.com","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"accessibility":"{\"nightShift\":true}","status":"active","locale":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"last_seen":{},"created_at":{},"updated_at":{},"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\",\"upload-a-theme\",\"using-the-editor\"]"}},"tags":{}}}},"query":{"include":"authors,tags,authors.roles"}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"no-cache, private, no-store, must-revalidate, max-stale=0, post-check=0, pre-check=0","x-cache-invalidate":"/p/aadc2626-9eb2-4f81-9933-191e7f29c18f/","location":"/ghost/api/v0.1/posts/5b71d40cdd62db5a3cfa038b/?status=draft","content-type":"application/json; charset=utf-8","etag":"W/\"291f-HTSv6X6UD1lVFQBzV6W+vUEfz3M\"","vary":"Accept-Encoding","content-encoding":"gzip"},"statusCode":201,"responseTime":"172ms"},"msg":"","time":"2018-08-13T18:55:08.546Z","v":0}

Not to mention, the cost of maintaining a website with such a setup was by no means cheap. This is when I started asking to my geeky friends about how they maintained their own personal websites.\\n\\nThe talks were very helpful, it made me realise that a dynamic blogging solution such as WordPress was overkill for a humble blog of less than 30 published posts like this one. Having a static site made so much more sense. I could write directly in Markdown, in the text editor of *my* choice. Not to mention, it made the workflow of writing a blog post just like I wrote code, `make`, `git commit`, and `git push` straight to GitHub Pages. GitHub Pages, by the way, offers completely *free* hosting for static sites. This means that the only thing I would need to pay for would be the custom domain name, a nominal ₹700 ($10) a year, an amount half of what I would be paying for a month of paid hosting. Plus, it would let me get my hands dirty with a bit of web development, something which I had pushed back for a long time.\\n\\nI decided to start this - what I knew was going to be painful task at about 11pm on a night I just knew I wouldn't be able to sleep.\\n\\nThe first step was to convert all my Blogger posts to Markdown. There were some tools online but all of them messed up the conversion pretty badly. After some more digging, I ended up using Aaron Swartz's [html2text](https://github.com/aaronsw/html2text) Python library which did a better job than other solutions in generating some useful Markdown. I still needed to edit every generated Markdown file by hand to make it something I would be happy with using on my site. I then had to export all the images I had on my Blogger site. This lead to a few more laborious hours of saving each image on the site by hand (Right Click -> View as Image -> Save As). It did cross my mind to automate everything with a script, but it was going to take more time to automate everything and check if the automation was working than it was to do the grunt work of pulling the images. With all the resources safely on my laptop and backed on my Dropbox, I took the next step of looking at static site generators to convert my lovingly handmade Markdown files to HTML.\\n\\nGitHub Pages seemed to heavily advocate [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) so I went with it first. With some tinkering to get the Ruby dependencies installed and posts adapted for Jekyll with the Front Matter content, I managed to get a pretty presentable blog running on localhost:4000/ at 5am on that day. With a quick push to my [github.io](http://shortstheory.github.com/) site, I decided to call it a night and slept off a sleep-deprived session of hacking.\\n\\nThe next few days I played with some more Jekyll themes and found that there were many things I didn't like about it. For one thing, it was written in Ruby which I have no experience with. Themes didn't look easy to work with and there was no native support for tags (there is a workaround for this, but due to my lack of Ruby-fu, it all looked terribly arcane to me). I then put the blog migration on the back burner for a while to work on projects at my college's Automation & Robotics Club.\\n\\nA few weeks later, I took a look at the blog project with some new perspective. I started by poking around for alternatives to Jekyll. There was one such alternative which ticked all my boxes - a static site generator called [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/). As WordPress looked inherently superior to Blogger, Pelican looked inherently superior to Jekyll for what I wanted to do with it. For example, it had built-in support for tags, had a theming engine, supported Markdown *and* reStructuredText, and had several easy to install plugins. Above all, Pelican is written in Python which made it so much easier for me to mess around with it. There were some more modifications to make to the Markdown files (particularly with the post metadata), but it was so trivial that it didn't pain one bit to modify all the files. Not too long after I settled on Pelican, I found a theme which made my blog look exactly how I wanted it to look. The [Pure Single](https://github.com/PurePelicanTheme) theme also has nifty support for custom sidebar images.\\n\\nThere was some initial trouble with setting a blog subfolder in the site and getting images to work on some auto-generated sites (such as the Tags and Categories pages). It later turned out that it was some problem with localhost/ not finding the paths correctly to the images and the site was totally fine when published to the GitHub Pages site. After only three days of using Pelican, I had something which I was willing to show off. The next step was much more straightforward for a change - registering a domain name. I looked into a few options such as GoDaddy, Hover, and Namecheap. Namecheap had positive reviews (unlike GoDaddy) and was the cheapest of the lot. The site configuration to serve pages from GitHub's servers was not more than a 10 minute procedure, and I finally had the site you are reading this article on right now.\\n\\nThere will be a lot more changes coming up on this blog, some of them aesthetic and some functional.

Not to mention, the cost of maintaining a website with such a setup was by no means cheap. This is when I started asking to my geeky friends about how they maintained their own personal websites.\\n\\nThe talks were very helpful, it made me realise that a dynamic blogging solution such as WordPress was overkill for a humble blog of less than 30 published posts like this one. Having a static site made so much more sense. I could write directly in Markdown, in the text editor of *my* choice. Not to mention, it made the workflow of writing a blog post just like I wrote code, `make`, `git commit`, and `git push` straight to GitHub Pages. GitHub Pages, by the way, offers completely *free* hosting for static sites. This means that the only thing I would need to pay for would be the custom domain name, a nominal ₹700 ($10) a year, an amount half of what I would be paying for a month of paid hosting. Plus, it would let me get my hands dirty with a bit of web development, something which I had pushed back for a long time.\\n\\nI decided to start this - what I knew was going to be painful task at about 11pm on a night I just knew I wouldn't be able to sleep.\\n\\nThe first step was to convert all my Blogger posts to Markdown. There were some tools online but all of them messed up the conversion pretty badly. After some more digging, I ended up using Aaron Swartz's [html2text](https://github.com/aaronsw/html2text) Python library which did a better job than other solutions in generating some useful Markdown. I still needed to edit every generated Markdown file by hand to make it something I would be happy with using on my site. I then had to export all the images I had on my Blogger site. This lead to a few more laborious hours of saving each image on the site by hand (Right Click -> View as Image -> Save As). It did cross my mind to automate everything with a script, but it was going to take more time to automate everything and check if the automation was working than it was to do the grunt work of pulling the images. With all the resources safely on my laptop and backed on my Dropbox, I took the next step of looking at static site generators to convert my lovingly handmade Markdown files to HTML.\\n\\nGitHub Pages seemed to heavily advocate [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) so I went with it first. With some tinkering to get the Ruby dependencies installed and posts adapted for Jekyll with the Front Matter content, I managed to get a pretty presentable blog running on localhost:4000/ at 5am on that day. With a quick push to my [github.io](http://shortstheory.github.com/) site, I decided to call it a night and slept off a sleep-deprived session of hacking.\\n\\nThe next few days I played with some more Jekyll themes and found that there were many things I didn't like about it. For one thing, it was written in Ruby which I have no experience with. Themes didn't look easy to work with and there was no native support for tags (there is a workaround for this, but due to my lack of Ruby-fu, it all looked terribly arcane to me). I then put the blog migration on the back burner for a while to work on projects at my college's Automation & Robotics Club.\\n\\nA few weeks later, I took a look at the blog project with some new perspective. I started by poking around for alternatives to Jekyll. There was one such alternative which ticked all my boxes - a static site generator called [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/). As WordPress looked inherently superior to Blogger, Pelican looked inherently superior to Jekyll for what I wanted to do with it. For example, it had built-in support for tags, had a theming engine, supported Markdown *and* reStructuredText, and had several easy to install plugins. Above all, Pelican is written in Python which made it so much easier for me to mess around with it. There were some more modifications to make to the Markdown files (particularly with the post metadata), but it was so trivial that it didn't pain one bit to modify all the files. Not too long after I settled on Pelican, I found a theme which made my blog look exactly how I wanted it to look. The [Pure Single](https://github.com/PurePelicanTheme) theme also has nifty support for custom sidebar images.\\n\\nThere was some initial trouble with setting a blog subfolder in the site and getting images to work on some auto-generated sites (such as the Tags and Categories pages). It later turned out that it was some problem with localhost/ not finding the paths correctly to the images and the site was totally fine when published to the GitHub Pages site. After only three days of using Pelican, I had something which I was willing to show off. The next step was much more straightforward for a change - registering a domain name. I looked into a few options such as GoDaddy, Hover, and Namecheap. Namecheap had positive reviews (unlike GoDaddy) and was the cheapest of the lot. The site configuration to serve pages from GitHub's servers was not more than a 10 minute procedure, and I finally had the site you are reading this article on right now.\\n\\nThere will be a lot more changes coming up on this blog, some of them aesthetic and some functional. I'm also probably going to change the name of this blog sometime soon, to something which is more reflective of my current sensibilities.\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","page":false,"published_at":"2017-02-05T18:20:00.000Z","slug":"blog-migration-complete","status":"published","title":"Blog Migration Complete!","updated_at":"2018-08-13T18:55:50.000Z","authors":{"0":{"id":"1","name":"arnav dhamija","slug":"arnav","email":"arnav.dhamija@gmail.com","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"accessibility":"{\"nightShift\":true}","status":"active","locale":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"last_seen":{},"created_at":{},"updated_at":{},"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\",\"upload-a-theme\",\"using-the-editor\"]"}},"tags":{"0":{"id":"5b71c661dd62db5a3cfa0358","name":"Misc","slug":"misc","description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","created_at":{},"updated_at":{},"parent_id":null},"1":{"name":"Programming","slug":null,"description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","parent_id":null}}}}},"query":{"include":"authors,tags,authors.roles"}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"no-cache, private, no-store, must-revalidate, max-stale=0, post-check=0, pre-check=0","x-cache-invalidate":"/*","content-type":"application/json; charset=utf-8","etag":"W/\"2c2c-UCseRzgHhblCfUIf3DiVZ97BOHU\"","vary":"Accept-Encoding","content-encoding":"gzip"},"statusCode":200,"responseTime":"300ms"},"msg":"","time":"2018-08-13T18:56:09.843Z","v":0}

The <a href=\"http://arnavdhamija.blogspot.in/\">old Blogger site</a> is still available if anyone wants to see it but for all future intents and purposes, this will be the place where new blog posts will be put up. While I <em>could</em> configure all traffic to the Blogger site to redirect to this one, the old site has grown on me so much over the years that I feel that it would be a shame to hide it that way.</p>\n<p>I had to migrate from Blogger because it is more than evident that Blogger has been getting less love from Google than it deserves. Take for instance, the Blogger web-based post editor - a shining example of an undeveloped relic of Google's products. Posts never autosaved or had any manual version control and a few misplaced keypresses could cause you to lose all your writing progress. Inserting images is a chore and putting up more complicated parts of text such as code blocks and sub-headings is even worse.</p>\n<p>Of course as with most things in software development, there are workarounds for everything. The work-around which I had used for the last few blog posts was to write directly in Markdown and then convert it to HTML with pandoc to copy paste in the Blogger editor. Even so, this is clearly sub-optimal and I was spending more time wrestling with the Blogger editor to make my pages look good than I was spending writing actual content. The Blogger theme which I was using appealled to me as 13 year old (heck, it still appeals to me), but it was growing long in the tooth and only had basic support for responsive design and mobile devices. With all these things in mind, I started looking for a new home for my blog somewhere in the middle of last December on a break from college.</p>\n<p>I first looked at <a href=\"http://wordpress.com/\">WordPress</a>. At first, it seemed like my search for a new blogging platform would stop here. Open-sourced, a great browser editor, a cohesive Android app, direct editing in Markdown, local installation for testing, and support for plugins made WordPress everything Blogger wasn't. I loved the number of themes and customisation WordPress provided. But the love was short lived, and it ended when I started researching hosting options for WordPress. Most solutions required me to rent a web-server on a monthly basis and I had no idea what tier of server to get as my blog had only recently seen a huge surge in pageviews. Not to mention, the cost of maintaining a website with such a setup was by no means cheap. This is when I started asking to my geeky friends about how they maintained their own personal websites.</p>\n<p>The talks were very helpful, it made me realise that a dynamic blogging solution such as WordPress was overkill for a humble blog of less than 30 published posts like this one. Having a static site made so much more sense. I could write directly in Markdown, in the text editor of <em>my</em> choice. Not to mention, it made the workflow of writing a blog post just like I wrote code, <code>make</code>, <code>git commit</code>, and <code>git push</code> straight to GitHub Pages. GitHub Pages, by the way, offers completely <em>free</em> hosting for static sites. This means that the only thing I would need to pay for would be the custom domain name, a nominal ₹700 ($10) a year, an amount half of what I would be paying for a month of paid hosting. Plus, it would let me get my hands dirty with a bit of web development, something which I had pushed back for a long time.</p>\n<p>I decided to start this - what I knew was going to be painful task at about 11pm on a night I just knew I wouldn't be able to sleep.</p>\n<p>The first step was to convert all my Blogger posts to Markdown. There were some tools online but all of them messed up the conversion pretty badly. After some more digging, I ended up using Aaron Swartz's <a href=\"https://github.com/aaronsw/html2text\">html2text</a> Python library which did a better job than other solutions in generating some useful Markdown. I still needed to edit every generated Markdown file by hand to make it something I would be happy with using on my site. I then had to export all the images I had on my Blogger site. This lead to a few more laborious hours of saving each image on the site by hand (Right Click -&gt; View as Image -&gt; Save As). It did cross my mind to automate everything with a script, but it was going to take more time to automate everything and check if the automation was working than it was to do the grunt work of pulling the images. With all the resources safely on my laptop and backed on my Dropbox, I took the next step of looking at static site generators to convert my lovingly handmade Markdown files to HTML.</p>\n<p>GitHub Pages seemed to heavily advocate <a href=\"http://jekyllrb.com/\">Jekyll</a> so I went with it first. With some tinkering to get the Ruby dependencies installed and posts adapted for Jekyll with the Front Matter content, I managed to get a pretty presentable blog running on localhost:4000/ at 5am on that day. With a quick push to my <a href=\"http://shortstheory.github.com/\">github.io</a> site, I decided to call it a night and slept off a sleep-deprived session of hacking.</p>\n<p>The next few days I played with some more Jekyll themes and found that there were many things I didn't like about it. For one thing, it was written in Ruby which I have no experience with. Themes didn't look easy to work with and there was no native support for tags (there is a workaround for this, but due to my lack of Ruby-fu, it all looked terribly arcane to me). I then put the blog migration on the back burner for a while to work on projects at my college's Automation &amp; Robotics Club.</p>\n<p>A few weeks later, I took a look at the blog project with some new perspective. I started by poking around for alternatives to Jekyll. There was one such alternative which ticked all my boxes - a static site generator called <a href=\"https://blog.getpelican.com/\">Pelican</a>. As WordPress looked inherently superior to Blogger, Pelican looked inherently superior to Jekyll for what I wanted to do with it. For example, it had built-in support for tags, had a theming engine, supported Markdown <em>and</em> reStructuredText, and had several easy to install plugins. Above all, Pelican is written in Python which made it so much easier for me to mess around with it. There were some more modifications to make to the Markdown files (particularly with the post metadata), but it was so trivial that it didn't pain one bit to modify all the files. Not too long after I settled on Pelican, I found a theme which made my blog look exactly how I wanted it to look. The <a href=\"https://github.com/PurePelicanTheme\">Pure Single</a> theme also has nifty support for custom sidebar images.</p>\n<p>There was some initial trouble with setting a blog subfolder in the site and getting images to work on some auto-generated sites (such as the Tags and Categories pages). It later turned out that it was some problem with localhost/ not finding the paths correctly to the images and the site was totally fine when published to the GitHub Pages site. After only three days of using Pelican, I had something which I was willing to show off. The next step was much more straightforward for a change - registering a domain name. I looked into a few options such as GoDaddy, Hover, and Namecheap. Namecheap had positive reviews (unlike GoDaddy) and was the cheapest of the lot.

I don't know if anyone still reads this blog, but I sure appreciate if you do!</p>\n<p>So, I guess some explanation is due here - it's been a combination of my lack of cohesive thought and lack of motivation to publish anything. Part of the reason is also that I've given a shot at the IIT-JEE which is something that I've wanted to write about for a while.</p>\n<p>For the uninitiated, the IIT-JEE is an entrance exam for the IITs which are regarded by some as the best engineering colleges in India. The exam is held at the end of 12th grade annually. Hundreds of thousands attempt the exam. Tens of thousands slog away countless hours of their last few years in high school preparing for it. Only a few hundred actually succeed.</p>\n<p>Like many with some strong aspirations of becoming an engineer, I stumbled upon this path a couple of years ago. I loved making/breaking things and had (what I felt) a keen interest in science, so it was a natural option for me to take some engineering related field over other options. I loved airplanes too and I would spend many happy hours on Wikipedia reading up about the Concorde (gorgeous plane), the XB-70, their engines, their airframe designs, and the engineers behind it all. I was fiercely determined to enter the aviation industry as an aerospace engineer to create a revolutionary aircraft on the lines of the Concorde.</p>\n<p>It's an unspoken reality that one's chances at IIT-JEE significantly decrease without the assistance of extra classes outside school, also known as coaching classes. I joined one at the start of the summer vacation prior to 11th called FIITJEE after getting a decent fee waiver via their admission test. I was no stranger to horror stories of 11th and 12th grade for school students, but I felt things would change for the better after the brain-numbing syllabus of 10th grade.</p>\n<p>And it did. To an extent. Things passed very quickly through the first few months of FIITJEE where I was tirelessly trying to understand every fragment of information that would probably help in making it through with a good rank in IIT Advance. My math wasn't strongest to begin with and I trudged along with chem with ambivalence to the subject material. Studying physics, both in class and at home was amazing. Thanks to our FIITJEE physics teacher, one of the best teachers I've ever had, physics by acompared long shot became my favorite subject for the next two years. It always just clicked and moreover studying physics and learning something new to solve an interesting problem was just <em>fun</em>. I remember physics and chemistry (primarily physics) passing along with relative smoothness but it felt like I was banging my head on a brick wall with math. This led to the vicious cycle of frustration, studying to remedy my weaknesses followed by more frustration when things didn't seem to be getting better. Despite all the apathy towards math I still managed to get through reasonably well with a consistent 2nd place in the phase tests and three digit ranks in the FIITJEE AIiTS. Unfortunately my reckless, unplanned approach towards studying in the first few months cost me greatly in other spheres of life and I was not a happy person to be around.</p>\n<p>It was around this point in time when I felt things slipping - yes, decent ranks in the phase tests were welcome but did it actually mean anything in such a sample set? There was also a storm brewing on the horizon - in the form of organic chemistry. Hard as I tried, I could never commit the material to memory. My woes with organic chem were exemplified with a jaw-dropping 11/25 in a school UT...which meant I had spent about 2 hours studying for every mark earned in that test :P</p>\n<p>Fortunately things slowly shaped up to look better right after 11th grade. Thanks to some quality teaching at FIITJEE and a lot time with chem textbooks organic chem started to become clearer for me. Shortly thereafter I managed to top Bangalore in FIITJEE's classroom program in the organic chem phase test. Of all the times I've had to bounce back from a tight situation in those 2 years, this was probably my highest point. Suddenly, exactly a year before IIT Advance 2015, the metaphorical glass was half full and no longer half empty. There was a calm feeling of conviction of a good possibility of me making it all the way for a 3 digit rank in IIT. Yes, my math was still well behind physics and chem but I had a year to work on it, right?</p>\n<p>Well not exactly. It just so happened that 12th grade started in full flow at this point and the constant neglect I had given to the school syllabus in 11th grade was no longer feasible. I couldn't continue just scraping by the school exams with minimal preparation as I had done in 11th. It dawned on me that I would have to manage both school and FIITJEE a lot more efficiently if I had to have a chance with making it to a good college. While physics was chugging along well, math severely needed a shot in the arm and chem got a whole lot uglier with 4 (or was it 5?) full organic chapters hastily finished off in FIITJEE just days before phase test 4. The neglect with the other two subjects was all too visible with me scoring 20 marks more in physics than chem and math combined (no I'm not a savant in physics, just an idiot with math :P). In the middle of all this, a few competitive programming experiences realigned my goals with respect to computer science and I started liking it almost as much as I used to obsess with aerospace engineering in the past.</p>\n<p><a name=\"screwup0\"></a><br>\nFor me, this turned into the beginning of a massive decline. For whatever reason, I succeeded in trashing both the KVPY and the NSEP - my biggest targets for 12th grade. School marks were about okay, but still less than ideal. Not in a great shape right now, huh? It proceeded to get worse when on one day in December 2014 I heard the news that because of my US citizenship, I was essentially out of the race for NITs, IIITs (note I was still in the running for IITs though) and a bunch of local colleges in Karnataka as well.</p>\n<p>Godammit.</p>\n<p>My passion for physics notwithstanding I might as well not have studied at all for IIT till then. It was a pretty big blow. Fortunately, what the government taketh, they giveth. I could make it to NITs through their international program (DASA) solely through subject SAT scores which shouldn't be to big of a deal given all the study towards JEE. If you've been reading this closely, you would have probably guessed that even that wasn't exactly straightforward since the only available day to attempt the subject SAT before the deadline was December 6, exactly a week after I heard about this scheme. The subject SATs themselves were uneventful - 2400. Incidentally, at this time math finally seemed to be shaping up for the first time since I chanced upon this business with FIITJEE. I could reasonably solve problems when in the mood which was a big change from how I used to dawdle with the subject earlier.</p>\n<p>Little did I know that is was the beginning of the biggest low I experienced - school pre-boards in January 2015 was an unmitigated disaster. 55% in math and about the same in chem with similarly bad marks across the board in CSc, physics, and English made for some very unpleasant conversations with my parents. Forget about JEE, at that point, even making the 80% in boards for qualifying cutoff was looking distant. Intertwined in this was the new BITS Hyderabad international admissions program which also made use of the good subject SAT score! But the twist was that they needed SAT reasoning scores too - which left me (yet again) with no option to attempt it within a week's time after the pre-boards to make the deadline. Gave it my all - 2220 overall or 1580/1600 CR+Math. With some assurance of BITS Hyderabad, college entrance exams totally took a backseat from the beginning of this year, the primary focus from then on being the board exams.</p>\n<p>It took a lot of effort to get started - those pre-board marks were not going to fix themselves and I had to make up almost the full year's syllabus in a bit more than a month to stand a chance. Eventually, the rote-learning mode grew on me and the board exams came and went in March without too much drama. Just the day before my last board exam, BITS Hyderabad sent an offer letter for taking up CSc at an 80% scholarship! For a few sweet minutes the pressure of the last two years was off.</p>\n<p><a name=\"entrancexams\"></a><br>\nIf you haven't slept off yet reading through all that, here's where it started to get interesting. Board exams done and dusted left me free to attempt the set of entrance exams at will - the main ones being JEE Mains/Advance and the BITSAT. With BITS Hyderabad CSc, I was of the opinion things could only get better as I could attempt all the exams with a free mind. This went on to be reasonably true - starting off with JEE Mains on the second Friday of April 2015 - I picked up 206/360 in JEE Mains with a solid 88/120 in physics, 83/120 in chem, and 35/120 (:P) in math. Though I would've hoped for it bit more, it turned out to be a better score than I thought it would be as the cutoffs had dropped by 10 marks from the previous year and that very few in my batch had scored higher. Much later on, it transpired that this JEE Mains score with my 95+% in CBSE would give me a decent shot at getting CSc at NIT, Surathkal campus, Aerospace Engineering at IISt, and hell, even decent choices (more so with the NTSE) at IIIT-H had it not been for my US citizenship.</p>\n<p>With this Mains result in hand, it led me to a crucial decision - study for the BITSAT and go for it all to get CSc at Pilani campus? Study for JEE Advance instead to salvage a decent rank especially since BITS unifies their curriculum across campuses? I decided to go for the BITSAT - after all my math was in no condition for the brunt of JEE Advance but I had a good shot of making up to a respectable level for the BITSAT, which is an objectively much easier exam.</p>\n<p><a name=\"bitsat\"></a><br>\nThis quickly turned into an obsession - with a BITSAT textbook by my side I started optimising and gaming the whole test to the minute with well divided time sections for all the subjects and strategies for almost all the possible outcomes at each stage. Math felt like it was finally on par with the other two subjects. With strong 350-370 scores after attempting all the questions in all the mock tests without the bonus 12 questions, it looked like that the dream of two years was finally within my grasp.</p>\n<p>But, for some inexplicable reason, I felt tremendous pressure just hours before the exam when I should have been getting a sound sleep. It was awful and I only managed to catch a few hours of sleep after finally going to sleep at 2am on the day of the exam scheduled at 830am.</p>\n<p>The sleep deprivation didn't augur well but that only partially sealed my fate. The invigilator gave me more rough paper than I was supposed to be given before the exam (the two rough booklets were somehow glued back to back), only to realize his mistake when I started the math section.</p>\n<p><em>This can't be happening</em>, I thought. <em>This isn't how it's supposed to all end.</em></p>\n<p>My extra rough sheets were confiscated by the proctor and then it hit me that this really was the final nail in the coffin. At that very moment the blood drained from my face realising that my chances were slipping by the second. With 90 minutes left to go but with no rough paper I was very much on the verge of giving up knowing that it really couldn't be worse. Math was never my strongest subject but attempting it without any rough paper was completely out of the question. Despite all this, I realized that I couldn't just let a dream of 2 years fall apart for such a pathetic issue and still went on with the test - guessing everything I could on the math section.</p>\n<p>I went for the extra 12 questions which were fine but I knew that the damage done from fluking most of math was irreparable. With the most anxiety I've ever experienced, I clicked the &quot;Submit Test&quot; button to see how I had done.</p>\n<p><strong>Your score: 307*</strong></p>\n<p>*<em>It was later revised to 311; 118/43</em></p>\n<p><strong>WTF</strong>.</p>\n<p>Surely it was just my sleep deprived brain that was seeing things, right? I rubbed my eyes, half expecting the last two digits of the score to reverse.</p>\n<p>I opened my eyes again. No change. Then I glanced towards the bottom of the screen and then I knew I had truly screwed the pooch.</p>\n<p><strong>Correct: 117</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Incorrect: 44</strong></p>\n<p>(Correctly marked answers are worth 3 marks and incorrectly marked answers lose 1 mark from the total)</p>\n<p>I stumbled out of the exam room/computer lab feeling absolutely numb. Speech was difficult without a torrent of tears.</p>\n<p>BITS Pilani CSc, heck, CSc at any BITS campus through BITSAT was an impossibility. It felt crushing and terrible to work so hard and to get so close only to ruin everything on the day of the exam for some issue that I had no control over. That day was not the first time I cried myself to sleep in those two years, but at least in those times there was a silver lining in getting another chance to do well in some other exam. There was no other exam left to do well in this time.</p>\n<p>Strangely the only solace at the time was that I had to give JEE Advance (is it spelled Advanced? My bad if it's wrong) with absolutely no preparation due to preparing for the BITSAT instead. So, I ended up with only three days to prepare for JEE Advance and did nothing more than three previous year's papers to make sure I wasn't wasting time on any particular section and to ensure I hadn't lost too much touch.</p>\n<p>24 May 2015 was the day. I knew I was going to be in serious trouble before even opening the question paper - the cover page of the question paper itself indicated that the next three hours were going to be pure torture with a ridiculous +4/-2 marking scheme on multiple correct option questions (this means more than one of the given MCQ options could be correct and failing to mark all the correct options would make one lose 2 marks), +4/0 integer type (think: a free response question with values from 0-9), and +2/-1 match the following (which is a whole lot more sinister than it sounds when you realise that MORE than one option in a column can be mapped to the other and all the correct options are required to be marked). It was a blur - all I remember was being completely deflated and slightly relieved that my ordeal only had another three hours with Paper 2 which followed a very similarly brutal marking scheme. I felt like I was in with a chance after doing the 2014 and 2012 question papers but there was no way I could squeeze out a good score with this. It was a bittersweet feeling after the those long 6 hours - sweet to think that the sweat and toil of the last two years was finally over and bitter to see how everything concerning my given entrance exams had fallen apart in the last week. The first thing I did on getting home from the exam was to sit down in the garden, on the grass and slowly piece together what exactly had happened. There were no tears as there had been for making a mess of the BITSAT - just a quiet resignation and mild shock that dreams had been shattered for good.</p>\n<p>Currently, I'm stuck at the difficult decision with taking BITS Hyderabad CSc BE or trying for a dual degree program at BITS Goa, taking physics and eventually CSc.</p>\n<p>Wow, that's easily been the longest single piece of writing I've ever done. I typed most of it on my phone on the plane, so apologies if it doesn't make too much sense. If you've made it all the way here, thanks for reading!</p>\n</div>","feature_image":"/content/images/2018/08/wall-organic.jpg","featured":false,"page":false,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","published_at":{},"published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":"","codeinjection_foot":"","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"authors":{"0":{"id":"1","name":"arnav dhamija","slug":"arnav","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":"{\"nightShift\":true}","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\",\"upload-a-theme\",\"using-the-editor\"]"}},"tags":{"0":{"id":"5b71d3a9dd62db5a3cfa0388","name":"JEE","slug":"jee","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","parent":null},"1":{"id":"5b71cdf6dd62db5a3cfa0376","name":"Life","slug":"life","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","parent":null}},"author":{"id":"1","name":"arnav dhamija","slug":"arnav","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":"{\"nightShift\":true}","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\",\"upload-a-theme\",\"using-the-editor\"]"},"primary_author":{"id":"1","name":"arnav dhamija","slug":"arnav","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":"{\"nightShift\":true}","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\",\"upload-a-theme\",\"using-the-editor\"]"},"primary_tag":{"id":"5b71d3a9dd62db5a3cfa0388","name":"JEE","slug":"jee","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","parent":null},"url":"/2015/06/17/t-2-years-and-counting-my-iit-jee-preparation-story/","comment_id":"5b71d36add62db5a3cfa0386"},"_locals":{"version":"1.25.4","safeVersion":"1.25","relativeUrl":"/2015/06/17/t-2-years-and-counting-my-iit-jee-preparation-story/amp/","secure":false,"client":{"id":"ghost-frontend","secret":"df0a31c219a6"},"context":{"0":"amp","1":"post"}}},"query":{}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"public, max-age=0","content-type":"text/html; charset=utf-8","content-length":"31427","etag":"W/\"7ac3-cEwtq9xRmFNqKMFEJa64UuJM81M\"","vary":"Accept-Encoding"},"statusCode":200,"responseTime":"41ms"},"msg":"","time":"2018-08-13T18:56:36.460Z","v":0}

My only gripe with this photo is that there are too many buildings in between and that it would've looked much better if I had shot it from around 50m above ground level.</p>\n<p>The other pictures you see are of the moon (if you haven't realized already :) ) These photos were taken over different days in the span of a few months and hence, the lighting changes considerably. My camera isn't a champion performer under low light conditions and the digital noise at high ISOs is evident. But I'll leave that to you to judge.

Recently bought myself some free time to publish a brand new blog post, centred on my photography work!</p>\n<p>I guess I also owe all of my avid readers an apology: it's been a really long time since my last photography post, so I hope I can make it up to you in this one!</p>\n<p>My previous photography posts:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/2012/05/08/photography-volume-3/\">Volume 3</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/2012/03/20/photography-volume-2/\">Volume 2</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/2011/10/19/photography-volume-1/\">Volume 1</a></p>\n<p>As usual, just click to enlarge!</p>\n<p>Starting off:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/08/IMG_1013.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_1013\"><br>\nI'm really in need of an entomologist here. I found this insect whilst walking down the road when a speck of orange caught my eye. Turns out that that speck of orange is one of the finest six-legged creatures I've ever seen. From a photography stand-point, I used a wide aperture, and a large zoom to capture this.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/08/IMG_2608.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_2608\"><br>\nThis is probably one of the most comical insect/bug pictures that I've ever taken. The DoF worked excellently over here; it only puts the subject in focus. The first thing that came to my mind after I shot this was &quot;suicide&quot;. Definitely one of my favourite shots.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/08/IMG_4283.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_4283\"><br>\nYay, another bug! I'm really scared of wasps, but that's the good thing about a superzoom camera: you can stand far away and still get a crisp shot. Pretty much the same ingredients were used to make this shot as the previous two.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/08/IMG_4286.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_4286\"><br>\nI should really call this post &quot;Bugs and Insects Special Album!&quot; or something. Poor jokes aside, I love the way the insect was climbing on the stigma/anthers (not too sure) of the flower. The background is sublimely blurred, but there's still enough detail to keep the background interesting. Top shot.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/08/IMG_4301.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_4301\"><br>\nThis is one picture I really like, but sometimes I feel remorseful seeing it. Although the reptile is in excellent focus, the handle of the water tap to the right distracts attention from it. Just goes to show that you can't always expect perfect conditions for photography.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/08/IMG_4564.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_4564\"><br>\nNo photography album is complete without a good flower. This is easily one of the prettiest flowers I've ever shot. Although I'm not too happy with the background, the foreground more than makes up for it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/08/IMG_4382.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_4382\"><br>\nYou're probably sick of seeing close-ups now, so I thought I'd throw in this picture that I took at sunset.  Everything worked in this photo, the orange clouds, the lovely Tyndall effect coming from the sun, and the coconut trees below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/08/IMG_4479.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_4479\"><br>\nAnother close-up! If I had to pass any comment about this, I would point out the robin's leisurely stride. It seems so relaxed, almost as if in a dream- like trance. Never mind my comments, post your own!</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/08/IMG_4845.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_4845\"><br>\nI really like this one. It's a very personified shot, the way the bird on the left is trying to say something, and the one on the right is taciturn and unwilling to respond. Their seating on the rocks is perfect and I also like the way they chose to pose right in front of the water-body.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/08/IMG_4884.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_4884\"><br>\n<img src=\"/content/images/2018/08/IMG_4892.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_4892\"></p>\n<p>I'm sorry if I've made you wince by showing you another insect picture (it has been enough of those!). Nevertheless, I'm really proud about taking these shots. They're both images of the same dragonfly from different angles. The first one has a nice background and excellent detail, while the second one exhibits a minimalistic appearance, with little to distract from the dragonfly itself.</p>\n<p>That's all for now! Please criticize, praise, and comment!</p>\n</div>","feature_image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","published_at":{},"published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":"","codeinjection_foot":"","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"authors":{"0":{"id":"1","name":"arnav dhamija","slug":"arnav","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":"{\"nightShift\":true}","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\",\"upload-a-theme\",\"using-the-editor\"]"}},"tags":{"0":{"id":"5b71c9a6dd62db5a3cfa0368","name":"Photography","slug":"photography","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","parent":null}},"author":{"id":"1","name":"arnav dhamija","slug":"arnav","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":"{\"nightShift\":true}","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\",\"upload-a-theme\",\"using-the-editor\"]"},"primary_author":{"id":"1","name":"arnav dhamija","slug":"arnav","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":"{\"nightShift\":true}","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\",\"upload-a-theme\",\"using-the-editor\"]"},"primary_tag":{"id":"5b71c9a6dd62db5a3cfa0368","name":"Photography","slug":"photography","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","parent":null},"url":"/2012/10/25/photography-volume-4/","comment_id":"5b71d0f7dd62db5a3cfa0380"},"_locals":{"version":"1.25.4","safeVersion":"1.25","relativeUrl":"/2012/10/25/photography-volume-4/amp/","secure":false,"client":{"id":"ghost-frontend","secret":"df0a31c219a6"},"context":{"0":"amp","1":"post"}}},"query":{}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"public, max-age=0","content-type":"text/html; charset=utf-8","content-length":"17907","etag":"W/\"45f3-210f2AhKdLn4GrEG1GshBzNWsJE\"","vary":"Accept-Encoding"},"statusCode":200,"responseTime":"54ms"},"msg":"","time":"2018-08-13T18:56:36.767Z","v":0}

It's been months since my last blog post, owing quite a bit to 10th grade and other activities. However, I'm back with a new, special post on what makes me tick behind the lens!</p>\n<p>Take this as my guide to hobbyist digital photography. I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Find something interesting to photograph:</em> While this might sound obvious, this is probably one of the most difficult things to accomplish in photography. A photo is a work of art: it needs to convey feelings, emotions, and beauty. If you don't have anything which can capture any of those three important guidelines, chances are you will end up with a dull photo. Photography isn't all about luscious landscapes or crafted close-ups. If you have a good degree of imagination, you can make anything look like a professional grade photograph, which brings me to my second point.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Be imaginative:</em> It's good to have a hard drive worth of photos shot at landmarks all over the world, but to be honest, you don't need that to be a good photographer. Imagination is probably the best thing that can change a common photo into a modern masterpiece. Just look outside your window. If you look closely and carefully for long enough, you'll definitely find something that can make an excellent photograph. Mess around with perspectives and your camera's settings and shutter times, and see what you get!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>You don't need the best camera to take good photos:</em> Don't get me wrong here, you're never going to get a high-grade photo from your 5-year old smartphone's camera. However, while it is no myth that a Canon 5D Mark III will consistently outperform your handy digital point-and-shoot camera, there's so much more to photography than just the camera and lens. Photographers need to have a good eye for detail and if you're not blessed with that, you can say farewell to all the awesome photos you thought you were going to shoot with your new DSLR. Having an eye for detail results in some wonderful photographs even with the most mediocre of cameras. I wouldn't call my Canon SX1-IS PowerShot (the camera which I've used to photograph all the photos posted on this blog) mediocre: it's actually a pretty good digital prosumer, but it's true that there are a huge bunch of DSLRs which exceed it in image quality.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, if you are fortunate enough to own a high-end camera and you have a passion for photography, chances are that you will be shooting like a pro in no time. A lower end camera won't offer you all the advanced features a prosumer/DSLR offers, but it'll do just fine for capturing most photos. Don't forget to keep lighting in mind, lighting conditions are very detrimental to taking good photos.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Learn about your camera:</em> This is very important. You might say, &quot;Hey, my camera's got a brilliant Automatic mode, I don't need to learn about nerdy photography terms!&quot; While it is true to an extent that camera nowadays are getting smarter and are able to deliver quality pictures even with minimal adjustment, you should learn about photography lingo right after you get comfortable with your camera. Why do you need to get comfortable first? That's because getting swamped with all the things you need to know to photograph with reasonable quality, isn't really the best way to start off your career in photography.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Just to give you a quick example, learn about terms such as: f-stops for Aperture, Shutter Speed (both are very important), ISO Film, digital noise, chromatic aberration, focal lengths, light metering, and the golden combination of all these things that make a good photo! A good photographer needs to thoroughly understand and know all these things to figure out how each one affects one another. Although it may seem daunting at first, I can tell you from personal experience that all it needs is just a few rounds of taking photos for one hour and a little bit of reading.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Get out there!:</em> Photos are never going to shoot themselves You need to be behind the camera and you need to be ready to experiment a lot to have a collection of quality photographs. It can seem impossible to take a good photo at times, but not everything can be photographed just the way you might want it to be. Learn from your own experiences and read up on how you can improve. I can safely bet with you that your experience will teach you more about photography than I, or any book can!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you've been patient enough to read all this, I wish you the best of luck in diving into the wonderful world of digital photography!</p>\n<p>Comments are much appreciated Thanks for reading!</p>\n</div>","feature_image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","published_at":{},"published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":"","codeinjection_foot":"","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"authors":{"0":{"id":"1","name":"arnav dhamija","slug":"arnav","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":"{\"nightShift\":true}","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\",\"upload-a-theme\",\"using-the-editor\"]"}},"tags":{"0":{"id":"5b71c9a6dd62db5a3cfa0368","name":"Photography","slug":"photography","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","parent":null}},"author":{"id":"1","name":"arnav dhamija","slug":"arnav","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":"{\"nightShift\":true}","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\",\"upload-a-theme\",\"using-the-editor\"]"},"primary_author":{"id":"1","name":"arnav dhamija","slug":"arnav","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":"{\"nightShift\":true}","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\",\"upload-a-theme\",\"using-the-editor\"]"},"primary_tag":{"id":"5b71c9a6dd62db5a3cfa0368","name":"Photography","slug":"photography","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","parent":null},"url":"/2012/09/09/photography-protips/","comment_id":"5b71d05cdd62db5a3cfa037d"},"_locals":{"version":"1.25.4","safeVersion":"1.25","relativeUrl":"/2012/09/09/photography-protips/amp/","secure":false,"client":{"id":"ghost-frontend","secret":"df0a31c219a6"},"context":{"0":"amp","1":"post"}}},"query":{}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"public, max-age=0","content-type":"text/html; charset=utf-8","content-length":"19108","etag":"W/\"4aa4-iPuIadzfNTGh8SFg19VCWwH8E6E\"","vary":"Accept-Encoding"},"statusCode":200,"responseTime":"56ms"},"msg":"","time":"2018-08-13T18:56:37.855Z","v":0}

Today also represents the 1st anniversary of this blog, and hence, I present my new photography album.</p>\n<p>Most of you would have already seen <a href=\"/2012/03/20/photography-volume-2/\">Volume 2</a> and <a href=\"/2011/10/19/photography-volume-1/\">Volume 1</a>, so you probably have an idea of my photography skills. I can only say that my skills have improved since then, as you will see in these photos.</p>\n<p>All of these photos were shot in either Aperture Priority (Av) or Shutter Speed Priority (Tv) modes, a step forward from shooting in  Program (P) mode. I like exercising full control over the camera, though the camera does a better job than me in choosing shutter speeds for apertures, so Av is the mode of choice.</p>\n<p>Technical chatter aside; the photos (click to enlarge):</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/08/IMG_6748.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_6748\"></p>\n<p>Let's start off with this. A rare shot with two animals. I can't offer any opinion as to why the squirrel didn't run away from there or why the bird landed there in the first place, but using a wide aperture and high zoom did wonders here.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/08/IMG_6770.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_6770\"></p>\n<p>Another squirrel? Well, actually it's the same one as in the previous picture. I'm at the risk of repeating photos over here, but this shot was way too good to pass up. The dark area which you see to the right of the image actually gives this photo a subtle effect and the squirrel's pose is fantastic. Using a digital camera gave me a wide choice of focal lengths without much adjustment. This one is 929 mm equivalent on a 35 mm film. Used f-stop 5.7 here, because wider apertures are beyond the camera's potential at these focal lengths.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/08/IMG_6799.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_6799\"></p>\n<p>Pretty nice shot here as well. It looks like a macro shot, but this one was shot from afar. The sunflower looks great here, and the tiny ladybug on the petals is the icing on the cake (or should I say flower?). The background was perfectly suited for this shot, and gives a nice empty space for this photo.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/08/IMG_6817.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_6817\"></p>\n<p>I won't lie to you by saying that this picture was taken at a different location from the previous one. I like the bee's placement in the flower and the flower itself. The flies and the varieties of insects that adorn the flower also look good over here. The background is one of my favourite parts of this photo, with details blurred to put emphasis on the main flower, but visible at the same time. It's a hard balance to maintain, but I'm glad that it worked over here.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/08/IMG_6972.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_6972\"></p>\n<p>Nothing special about the photography techniques over here, but photographing another creature, and a reptile at that was too good to pass up.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/08/IMG_7304.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_7304\"></p>\n<p>I suppose the colour over here is the main part of the photo. Clarity and contrast are also impressive. The flower itself looks exotic enough, though I have no idea what it is. Flowers are probably the best subjects in photography. They are quite beautiful, move very little and you can try a hundred different exposures to get the right shot.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/08/IMG_7327.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_7327\"></p>\n<p>While I'll be mean to call this an ugly butterfly (I'm sure it's not a moth!), I think it looks magnificent over here. Although eye-pleasing colours are practically non-existent in this photo, you should look at the contrast of the ground to the insect. It looks pretty good, and the other insects around the butterfly provide a level of detail, without which, this photo would look much plainer.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/08/IMG_7331.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_7331\"></p>\n<p>Probably one of the best shots I took on that day. The coconut as a subject may make you raise eyebrows, but it's totally unlike anything else I've shot. The focusing was perfect here, giving the photo a very small depth of field. Less can be more and this shot exemplifies it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/08/IMG_7583.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_7583\"></p>\n<p>You might've seen that I've only done close-up shots. This is one of the very few landscape shots I've taken. Excellent scenery and I really don't have much more to say about this.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/08/IMG_7583-1.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_7583-1\"></p>\n<p>The mynah had a nice stance and perching position for this. The background is suitably blurred over here and the foreground falls into focus nicely. The background is great for this and the bird's details are captured with some success.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/08/IMG_8064.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_8064\"></p>\n<p>It might look odd to photograph only the head of a peacock without its resplendent body. But the head itself actually has fantastic detail. The blue colour stands out superbly and there is a generous amount of empty space in the photo which is essential for greater emphasis on the bird.

It's not about time (or the lack of it), it's just laziness. Well, a lot of stuff has happened this month (and a lot of pics have been taken), which I simply can't do justice to by putting it in words.</p>\n<p>I suppose, I've found a new love as well, some people are going to hate this...</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/08/Pokemon-PNG-Pic.png\" alt=\"Pokemon-PNG-Pic\"></p>\n<p>...well actually it's not a new love, this dates back to 2004, so I'll narrate my history with this incredible video-game.</p>\n<p>Back in 2004 when I was only 6 years-old, I was everything one could describe as a Pokemon fan. I used to watch the anime a lot, watched all the released movies, and even had Pokemon drawing and colouring books. In 2005, I was introduced to the world of Pokemon video-games, which I never knew existed. I remember how popular Pokemon used to be in my apartment complex, it was as if a GameBoy Advance and a Pokemon cartridge was like a piece of clothing, which you could not <em>not</em> have when going outside. The rage was infectious, and I soon caught on. I got my first Pokemon game as a birthday gift - Pokemon Sapphire.</p>\n<p>So, with great exuberance, I got my first Gym badge, saved my game and went to bed. The next day when I woke up, and loaded the game, I was greeted with this message:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/08/deleted-file.jpg\" alt=\"deleted-file\"></p>\n<p>Serious disappointment. I tried saving again, but got the same message. I thought my Pokemaster career had come to a standstill, which it actually had. So, for the next few months, all I could do was gaze in envy at my friends' games which actually saved. Why only for a few months? Because, in February 2006, I got an original FireRed. With the same anxiousness, I tried saving, and obviously (but to my surprise), it actually worked! Joy. What followed was me getting an original Emerald as well, so I knew my career was well on its way. It was a lot of fun, when we were allowed to bring our GameBoys to school, and see whose Level 100 Mewtwo was better. I must clocked at least a total of 600 hours on both games, but in the middle of 2007, I was hit by a GameBoy ban, which didn't end till summer 2008. By then, I totally lost interest, and the GameBoy took its place as being a convenient paperweight and dust collector. Never touched it again for three years.</p>\n<p>Then, in 2011, some of my friends came over with their GameBoys to ask me some Pokemon questions and how to get to Navel Rock without a GameShark. Of course, I had lost most of my expertise on the subject, and we never got to Navel Rock. But then, it brought back to me the fond memories of playing Pokemon, and thinking &quot;Hey, this is fun!&quot;. The very next day, I downloaded an emulator and Emerald ROM, just to relive those moments.</p>\n<p>It was brilliant, playing Pokemon on that queer low-resolution and basic pseudo-2.5D models. I couldn't care less about the life-like graphics in other games. This was for me. I frantically hunted for my FireRed and Emerald cartridges, but both of them were lost. Lost forever. It was a heart-breaking moment.</p>\n<p>Soon after, I began trawling sites like Bulbapedia and Serebii, to catch up on what I missed.</p>\n<p>It was an awful lot. But, looking closer, I saw a very sharp competitive edge to the game. I was amazed, and soon after, I swallowed the concept of EVs, IVs, and natures.</p>\n<p>I downloaded Pokemon Platinum and DS emulator for fun. I never thought I would actually play it. I couldn't have been more wrong. I played the whole game and beat the Battle Frontier with all my newly-gained knowledge.</p>\n<p>But soon, I realised, there's no way of playing with a real person like this. So, I (nervously) asked my parents for a DS + Pokemon Black (I would've never asked, if I hadn't got scholarship). But that was easily the best things I could ever buy. A Cosmo Black 3DS and Pokemon Black. All I could've ever wanted. I've played around 70 Wi-Fi battles, and won like 30 of them. I turned to sites like <a href=\"http://smogon.com/\">Smogon</a>. It was incredible, a whole community of smart, competitive Pokemon players. It was just the place for me. A few months ago, I became a member, and my Pokemon journey continues to advance.</p>\n<p>That's my story. Hope you guys liked it.

The old collection can be found <a href=\"/2011/10/19/photography-volume-1/\">here.</a></p>\n<p>Note: not all my photos here are &quot;new, new&quot; photos. Some of them are exceptional shots I took before publishing my last post, but I didn't want to post two pics of the same thing.</p>\n<p>Moving on....(click to enlarge)</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/08/IMG_5317.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_5317\"></p>\n<p>A really neat pose of that squirrel. I didn't expect the sunlight and the ground to merge so well together.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/08/IMG_5391.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_5391\"></p>\n<p>Looks like it's been pulled out of a rainforest. The truth is, i found these little birds in my backyard. I love the way the birds sit linearly, almost like a family picture.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/08/IMG_5575.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_5575\"></p>\n<p>This was a bit of an experiment, with very impressive results. Shot it under low lighting with flash at a certain angle, so you can see all the layers of petals in the flower.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/08/IMG_5696.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_5696\"></p>\n<p>Slimy snail; and although the picture doesn't exhibit too many photography techniques, it looks pretty decent.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/08/IMG_5935.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_5935\"></p>\n<p>The grasshopper/mantis (I'm no entomologist) strikes an excellent pose for this photo. The raised forearms and the spread out legs give it a great stance.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/08/IMG_6043.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_6043\"></p>\n<p>A really simple pic, but that's what makes it look detailed and elegant.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/08/IMG_6066.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_6066\"></p>\n<p>Cute little birdie. That sounds really stupid. Anyway, I like the perching position of the bird, and the contrast of its black head to its yellow body (sorry if that sounds racist). Birds and insects seem to love posing for me.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/08/IMG_6149.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_6149\"></p>\n<p>Wow, this picture was an absolute stunner for me. I heard the cat screeching in pain before I found it (probably &quot;cat&quot;fighting). The way its body is silhouetted and the light gleaming off the feline's eyes make it an amazing and thoughtful picture.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/08/IMG_6164.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_6164\"></p>\n<p>Kind of a filler pic. The flower looks pretty, and I can't say much about this.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/08/IMG_5639.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_5639\"></p>\n<p>Perfect pose + perfect clarity + cool insect = awesomeness. The macro worked exceptionally well here.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/08/IMG_6177.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_6177\"></p>\n<p>An example of good timing, this picture was taken early in the morning. The bees seemed to be rising with me and the sharpness in front and the blurred out background, make it another sweet shot.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2018/08/IMG_6199.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_6199\"></p>\n<p>I don't have enough words to describe how much I love this one. At a first glance, you might not see much, but look at the thing looming over the moth's (yes it is a moth) body. Do you count four legs a side? Yup, a spider was ingesting its prey in this one, and seeing it in real life was eerie. Although I can't bring out all the life or death in this photo, I hope you get the message.</p>\n<p>I know you'll enjoy these photos, no need to hope.</p>\n<p>Comment, criticize and praise as you wish.</p>\n</div>","feature_image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","published_at":{},"published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":"","codeinjection_foot":"","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"authors":{"0":{"id":"1","name":"arnav dhamija","slug":"arnav","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":"{\"nightShift\":true}","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\",\"upload-a-theme\",\"using-the-editor\"]"}},"tags":{"0":{"id":"5b71c9a6dd62db5a3cfa0368","name":"Photography","slug":"photography","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","parent":null}},"author":{"id":"1","name":"arnav dhamija","slug":"arnav","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":"{\"nightShift\":true}","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\",\"upload-a-theme\",\"using-the-editor\"]"},"primary_author":{"id":"1","name":"arnav dhamija","slug":"arnav","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":"{\"nightShift\":true}","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\",\"upload-a-theme\",\"using-the-editor\"]"},"primary_tag":{"id":"5b71c9a6dd62db5a3cfa0368","name":"Photography","slug":"photography","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","parent":null},"url":"/2012/03/20/photography-volume-2/","comment_id":"5b71cb36dd62db5a3cfa036e"},"_locals":{"version":"1.25.4","safeVersion":"1.25","relativeUrl":"/2012/03/20/photography-volume-2/amp/","secure":false,"client":{"id":"ghost-frontend","secret":"df0a31c219a6"},"context":{"0":"amp","1":"post"}}},"query":{}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"public, max-age=0","content-type":"text/html; charset=utf-8","content-length":"17247","etag":"W/\"435f-8DDYuzKieVuX7CfTtRMeB43r8D4\"","vary":"Accept-Encoding"},"statusCode":200,"responseTime":"37ms"},"msg":"","time":"2018-08-13T18:56:38.374Z","v":0}

Viewing from not an expert's position, not from a parent's position, not from a teacher's position, but from a high school, bored student's perspective, this post is just a rant about our muddled education system.</p>\n<p><strong>CCE</strong>: This was supposed to be the next big thing to do away with exams. However, the government's magic wand failed to do much on these counts, and instead of doing away with exams, it succeeded to give us a cornucopia of projects and assignments, to keep us busy in our already syncopated free time. It probably could've done a lot more if they had revised their assessment, but.....</p>\n<p><strong>Emphasis on exams</strong>: What the education board has largely taught the majority of Indian students is that failure in exams is tantamount to failure in life. It screams to say that exams are the most important thing that could have happened since the Big Bang, and that failing could just as well result in the destruction of the universe itself. It would be an understatement to say that &quot;10th graders in India suicide&quot;, because the existence threatening virus has got to almost all age groups. For the sake of lives, try to change these stereotypes, CBSE.</p>\n<p><strong>Lack of thinking problems</strong>: OK, I know what my fellow students are thinking on these counts in math (no pun intended), but problems like these are reserved for &quot;higher classes&quot;. It's like slowly walking on a long path and then being forced to run a marathon. Yeah, these problems can't be left out early for the benefit of the &quot;average student&quot;. Sure, it is tough going early, but it will pay off in the end. The bar of the &quot;average student&quot; needs to be raised a notch higher on the metaphoric ladder.</p>\n<p>If you want more evidence, just look at India's IMO (International Mathematics Olympiad) rating of 72nd out of 73 countries. An average South Korea's 3rd grader is astonishingly  just as good as an average Indian 8th grader at mathematical/mental ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Hindi</strong>: As if the subject wasn't terrifying enough, some wise guy decided to give kids 15 chapters of boredom and then ask arbitrary questions in exams. With themes ranging from dirt, mud and random biographies, the Hindi syllabus clearly wasn't reviewed by a person brought up in a ubiquitous English community. If CBSE can reduce the bar so nonchalantly for sciences, why was this treatment skipped for Hindi?</p>\n<p><strong>Uniformed board</strong>: This probably saves a lot of confusion, but it means that it needs to cater to all types of society for what the board considers &quot;relevant&quot;. Things like forestry and agriculture are hardly needed in urban areas, but then again, this is according to me, not them.</p>\n<p><strong>Policies</strong>: Read plural of policy and not law enforcing officers. RTE plans to give education to everyone, which sounds like a nice idea, but in reality is far-fetched. With most 3rd graders failing to pass basic English reading tests (94% to be exact), something seems to be wrong. Even if they somehow do get everyone educated, not everyone can get a job in this country, leaving lots of wasted talent.</p>\n<p>On a more positive note, literacy rates have jumped by over 12% since 2001's census. Great news, but these shortcomings give one some food for thought.</p>\n<p>Comment, criticise and praise at your own will.</p>\n</div>","feature_image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","published_at":{},"published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":"","codeinjection_foot":"","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"authors":{"0":{"id":"1","name":"arnav dhamija","slug":"arnav","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":"{\"nightShift\":true}","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\",\"upload-a-theme\",\"using-the-editor\"]"}},"tags":{"0":{"id":"5b71c839dd62db5a3cfa0363","name":"Rants","slug":"rants","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","parent":null}},"author":{"id":"1","name":"arnav dhamija","slug":"arnav","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":"{\"nightShift\":true}","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\",\"upload-a-theme\",\"using-the-editor\"]"},"primary_author":{"id":"1","name":"arnav dhamija","slug":"arnav","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":"{\"nightShift\":true}","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\",\"upload-a-theme\",\"using-the-editor\"]"},"primary_tag":{"id":"5b71c839dd62db5a3cfa0363","name":"Rants","slug":"rants","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","parent":null},"url":"/2012/02/03/rantings-indian-education/","comment_id":"5b71caeadd62db5a3cfa036c"},"_locals":{"version":"1.25.4","safeVersion":"1.25","relativeUrl":"/2012/02/03/rantings-indian-education/amp/","secure":false,"client":{"id":"ghost-frontend","secret":"df0a31c219a6"},"context":{"0":"amp","1":"post"}}},"query":{}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"public, max-age=0","content-type":"text/html; charset=utf-8","content-length":"18020","etag":"W/\"4664-EsrXzkUAw4OeEUa6LNtBfJ5k0Xg\"","vary":"Accept-Encoding"},"statusCode":200,"responseTime":"24ms"},"msg":"","time":"2018-08-13T18:56:38.727Z","v":0}

According to me population growth is <em>not</em> a good trend and achieving it has some serious implications. The world is already ridden with poverty, AIDS and a host of problems with which the majority of the population can not keep up with. Sure, we have more people and man-force.
