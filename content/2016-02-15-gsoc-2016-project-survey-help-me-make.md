Hey everyone!  

I am a first year computer science undergraduate from BITS Pilani, Hyderabad
Campus. I am looking forward to working for KDE for the GSoC.  

![](https://developers.google.com/open-

My project idea is based on solving a problem all file managers have had for
years - the lack of an easy to use file selection tool. My project aims to
simplify selecting files from multiple directory trees.  

I am running a survey to gauge community feedback on my idea and to finalize
the user interface and features list.  

The link to my idea proposal can be found here: <https://goo.gl/1Nj4SY>  

And the link to my survey can be found here: <https://goo.gl/forms/5JSZXNganX>  

TIA for the feedback : )
