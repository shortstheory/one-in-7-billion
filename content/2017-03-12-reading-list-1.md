I've been trying to get myself to read more books. It's been an interesting experience to wane myself off of social media on my phone and it certainly deserves a post of its own soon. Until then, here are some of my thoughts on books I finished reading this year.

* The Checklist Manifesto

The title gives away the premise of the book - which is about the art of managing and creating efficient checklists. This may not exactly sound like a jaw clenching thriller of a book, but Atul Gawande manages to keep the pages turning with interesting anecdotes about checklists. A surgeon by profession, Gawande lists instances of how having a carefully curated surgery checklist has saved lives in the operating theatre. As an aviation geek, I enjoyed story about how creating a pre-flight checklist for the Boeing 299 saved Boeing from the brink of bankruptcy in a fiercely competitive aviation market. There are narratives about the flipside too. For example, verbose checklists with too many steps for the user to follow may do more harm than having no checklist at all.

For the most part, the book reads as a collection of anecdotes of varying quality. Advice about creating a good checklist is scattered too thin throughout the book to be useful. I would give the book a tentative thumbs up. That said, my rating of this book is probably not the best thing to go by as I finished the book over a period of months which broke the continuty of the book which wasn't very continuous to begin with.

* Freakonomics

This books seems to pop up in almost every bookstore or library I go to. I had been listening to the Freakonomics podcast for quite a while, but I decided to get into this book only a few weeks ago. The cover itself makes bold claims such as *"...Explores The Hidden Side of Everything"* along with some terms of endearment from Malcolm Gladwell. The book covers a range of bizarre topics such as 'What do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common?' and 'Why Do Drug Dealers Still Live with Their Moms?'. Which is great, because the book does make convincing conclusions on these two topics. However, this conviction cannot be said for some of the other chapters such as 'What Makes a Perfect Parent?' and how a child's name is detrimental to their future prospects. I feel the book doesn't spend enough time establishing how a certain cause leads to an effect in these chapters.

* Russian Roulette

It took me forever to find this book. I used to read Alex Rider books every once in a while in school, but lost track of the series in my dry spell of reading. Russian Roulette is something of a spin-off book, set somewhere in the middle of Stormbreaker in the Alex Rider timeline. RR narrates the story of Yassen, a key character throughout the Alex Rider series. Like most Anthony Horowitz books, it's not a well-written book with rich language and outstanding prose. Rather, it keeps one engaged with a fast (but somewhat predictable) plotline. I liked some of the parts from Yassen's past in Russia, though the rest was a rehash of a different Alex Rider book.

* Bird by Bird

In this book, Anne Lammot speaks about the joys and frustrations in the solidary world of a writer. From the outset, I loved this book. Lammot's writing style is hillarious and is loaded with dry wit and sarcasm. As with 'The Checklist Manifesto', the book follows off on tangents with no central plot to speak of. On my first read of 'Bird by Bird', I couldn't help feeling that this book would read better as a blog than a novel.
