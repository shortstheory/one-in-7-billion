* why i like to call it time Optimisation
* avoid uDistractions
    * social media and phone
* brain poor context switching
* try to batch in tasks you like doing to feel productive
* mix downtime with things you like doing
* frequent breaks
* batch tasks together
* disclaim that self is actually pretty useless at all of the above :P
