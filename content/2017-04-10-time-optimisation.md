* why i like to call it time Optimisation

It's a cliche to hear that things would be so much better if I had my managed time better. Say if I had spent a bit more time finishing off an assignment or cleaning my room then diving in for a couple of hours of Skyrim. I've never really liked th sound of the phrase "Time Managament" either. Maybe because it was mostly used in the context of my parents goading pre-adolescent me to study.

Time Optimisation on the other hand feel like a much more fitting term. For one inestead of putting the emphasis on controlling an 'x' number of hours in your day, it aims to make the optimal use of time pertaining to the situation. They are two sides of the coin - time management will help you get a macro picture of your day and time optimisation will help you micromanage that.

* avoid uDistractions
* brain poor context switching
* social media and phone
A big problem with trying to be productive in the last 5-10 years is that it's much harder to ignore mirco-distractions. Micro-distractions manifest themselves a lot more frequently in the form of smartphones. It is a problem on two counts - for one, the human brain is *terrible* at context switching. You might pride yourself for your incredible ability to multi-task, but you're still inherently limited by evolution. More often than not, I forget what I was working on when I put down my phone to respond to something. Apart from this, a five-minute break might not sound like something which impacts productivity too much, but all those minutes do add up when you're doing it five times an hour.

* try to batch in tasks you like doing to feel productive

* mix downtime with things you like doing

* frequent breaks
* better to take break than to do unproductive work
* batch tasks together
* disclaim that self is actually pretty useless at all of the above :P
