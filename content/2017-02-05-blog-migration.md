Now I finally have my very own domain name! The [old Blogger site](arnavdhamija.blogspot.in) is still available if anyone wants to see it but for all future intents and purposes, this will be the place where new blog posts will be put up. While I *could* configure all traffic to the Blogger site to redirect to this one, the old site has grown on me so much over the years that I feel that it would be a shame to hide it that way.

I had to migrate from Blogger, because, while it was good platform when it was released, it is more than evident that Blogger has been getting less love from Google than it deserves. Take for instance, the Blogger web post editor - a shining example of ancient inefficiences. Posts were never autosaved or version controlled and a few misplaced keypresses could cause you to lose all your writing progress. Inserting images is a chore and putting up more complicated parts of text such as code blocks and sub-headings is even worse.

Of course, the work-around which I had used for the last few blog posts was to write direcly in Markdown and then convert it to HTML to copy paste in the Blogger editor. But this is clearly sub-optimal and I was spending more time wrestling with the editor than I was writing actual content.
