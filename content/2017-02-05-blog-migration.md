Now I finally have my very own domain name! The [old Blogger site](arnavdhamija.blogspot.in) is still available if anyone wants to see it but for all future intents and purposes, this will be the place where new blog posts will be put up. While I *could* configure all traffic to the Blogger site to redirect to this one, the old site has grown on me so much over the years that I feel that it would be a shame to hide it that way.

I had to migrate from Blogger, because, while it was good platform when it was released, it is more than evident that Blogger has been getting less love from Google than it deserves. Take for instance, the Blogger web post editor - a shining example of ancient inefficiences. Posts were never autosaved or version controlled and a few misplaced keypresses could cause you to lose all your writing progress. Inserting images is a chore and putting up more complicated parts of text such as code blocks and sub-headings is even worse.

Of course as with a lot of things in software development, there are workarounds for everything. The work-around which I had used for the last few blog posts was to write direcly in Markdown and then convert it to HTML with pandoc to copy paste in the Blogger editor. Even so, this is clearly sub-optimal and I was spending more time wrestling with the Blogger editor to make my pages look good than I was writing actual content. The theme which I had been using for Blogger ever since I started it appealed to me as a 13 year old (heck, it still appeals me), but it was growing long in the tooth and only had basic support for responsive design and mobile devices. With all these things in mind, I started looking for a new home for my blog somewhere in the middle of last December on a break from college.

I first looked at WordPress. At first, it seemed like my search for a new blogging platform would stop with WordPress. Open-source, a great browser editor, a cohesive Android app, direct editing in Markdown, local installation for testing, and support for plugins made WordPress everything Blogger wasn't. I loved the number of themes and customisation WordPress provided. But the love was short lived, and it ended when I started researching hosting options for WordPress. Most solutions required me to rent a web-server on a monthly basis and I had no idea what tier of server to get as my blog had only recently seen a huge surge in pageviews. Not to mention, the cost of maintaining a website with such a setup was by no means cheap.
