It's been over a year since I switched laptops. Since I spend a considerable amount of time in front of one, 

It wasn't an easy decision between the T460s and the 13. The T460s was definitely a more charming laptop but there were just too many drawbacks for me to take it as a serious contender. I found several negative reviews regarding the battery life and the 1080p panel lottery. The ThinkPad 13 wasn't without issues of its own, but there wasn't a single review that hadn't sung praises about its keyboard, battery life, and overall value proposition. Plus it came with a USB Type-C port, dual upgradeable RAM slots, and was at least $200 cheaper than a comparitively specced T460s.

I got the silver version of the ThinkPad 13. Die-hard ThinkPad fans might find a non-black ThinkPad heresy, but I really like the way it looks. At the time, the silver version came with the free 1080p IPS display upgrade. It also has a better choice of materials with an aluminium lid in place of the ABS plastic lid found on the black version of the ThinkPad 13. I got it configured with the following specs:

| Component        | Config           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| CPU      | Intel Core i5 6300U |
| RAM      | 8 GB DDR4-2133      |
| Disk | 256GB LiteON SSD      |
| Display | 1920x1080 13.3" IPS   |

Since I was saving a fair bit of money by not buying the T460s, I maxed out the CPU with the i5-6300U though I don't ever see myself using vPro.

## Build Quality

*Pretty* decent. At 1.4kg it's not the smallest or lightest 13.3" laptop available, but it's small enough to not matter. Given the number of I/O ports onboard, it's a very acceptable compromise.

It isn't made from the fancy composites of the X1 Carbon or the magnesium alloy of the T/X/P series ThinkPads. Yet the plastic frame of the laptop is really good quality and can easily stand on its own. Compared to other ThinkPads I've tried, it feels considerably better built than the E470 and the X1 Yoga and is about on par, if not better than the T440p. The P50 is more solid, though it must be kept in mind that the P50 is a much larger laptop than the 13. The build quality is on another level compared to the Lenovo IdeaPad G580 I had been using before this.

The hinges are nice and tight and the lid gives a satisfying thump on closing. Speaking of which, the aluminium lid is solid and protects the display nicely. However, it does give the laptop a heterogeneous look and feel with the rest of the frame being made of plastic.

One aside here, the 13 does have unique touches not found on higher end models. For example, the "i's" in the ThinkPad in both the lid and the palm-rest glow and ThinkPad logo has a really nice brushed finish to it on the lid.

Opening the laptop for servicing and upgrading is not a good experience. The bottom base is held by 10 captive screws and is incredibly fiddly to pry open. I ended up scratching off some of the paint of the bottom cover in the two times I tried opening the base. That said, upgradability is much better than what you can find on comparable ultrabooks. Both DDR4 RAM slots, the M.2 SATA SSD (no NVMe on Gen. 1 unfortunately), the WiFi card, and battery can be easily replaced.

The touchpad has its share of mechanical issues too. It is a clickpad design, similar to that found on older MacBooks. Sometimes dust/debris would find its way in the gap between the base of the laptop, causing the right button to stop physically clicking. It's a simple problem to fix and all it needs is a swap with a piece of thick paper to clean the underside of the touchpad. Nevertheless, I expected a more durable design when it comes to this.

The plastic construction does have some drawbacks when it comes to scratches. Part of the lid is plastic and is considerably more scratched up than the aluminium part of it. After a year, the base unit also had some paint rubbing off from the edges. I would suggest buying a carrying sleeve to avoid this from happening. Fortunately, all the damage is only cosmetic and the laptop has held up pretty well after being jostled around campus for more than a year.

## I/O

Connectivity is a strong point for the ThinkPad 13. It's impressive to see how many ports there are on a laptop of this size! You get 3 USB-A ports running at USB 3.0 speeds, a full size HDMI port, an SD card reader in which the card goes all the way in, a headphone jack, *and* a USB-C port supporting charging and 4K60fps video out. There's also Lenovo's propietary OneLink+ docking solution though I haven't tried this out yet.
