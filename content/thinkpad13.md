It's been over a year since I switched laptops. Since I spend a considerable amount of time in front of one, 

It wasn't an easy decision between the T460s and the 13. The T460s was definitely a more charming laptop but there were just too many drawbacks for me to take it as a serious contender. I found several negative reviews regarding the battery life and the 1080p panel lottery. The ThinkPad 13 wasn't without issues of its own, but there wasn't a single review that hadn't sung praises about its keyboard, battery life, and overall value proposition. Plus it came with a USB Type-C port, dual upgradeable RAM slots, and was at least $200 cheaper than a comparitively specced T460s.

I got the silver version of the ThinkPad 13. Die-hard ThinkPad fans might find a non-black ThinkPad heresy, but I really like the way it looks. At the time, the silver version came with the free 1080p IPS display upgrade. It also has a better choice of materials with an aluminium lid in place of the ABS plastic lid found on the black version of the ThinkPad 13. I got it configured with the following specs:

| Component        | Config           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| CPU      | Intel Core i5 6300U |
| RAM      | 8 GB DDR4-2133      |
| Disk | 256GB LiteON SSD      |
| Display | 1920x1080 13.3" IPS   |

Since I was saving a fair bit of money by not buying the T460s, I maxed out the CPU with the i5-6300U though I don't ever see myself using vPro.

Since the ThinkPad 13 Gen. 2 and Gen. 1 share the same build, most of the parts of this review regarding build quality apply for the Gen. 2 as well. The Gen. 2 does have a bump in some features - such as supporting NVMe SSDs.

## Build Quality

*Pretty* decent. At 1.4kg it's not the smallest or lightest 13.3" laptop available, but it's small enough to not matter. Given the number of I/O ports onboard, it's a very acceptable compromise.

It isn't made from the fancy composites of the X1 Carbon or the magnesium alloy of the T/X/P series ThinkPads. Yet the plastic frame of the laptop is really good quality and can easily stand on its own. Compared to other ThinkPads I've tried, it feels considerably better built than the E470 and the X1 Yoga and is on par, if not better than the T440p. The P50 is more solid, though it must be kept in mind that the P50 is a much thicker laptop than the 13. The 13's build quality is on another level compared to the Lenovo IdeaPad G580 I had been using before this. Even after a year of heavy use, creaking on twisting the frame is non-existent and nothing feels like it's on the verge of falling apart like it did with the IdeaPad.

The hinges are nice and tight and the lid gives a satisfying thump on closing. Speaking of which, the aluminium lid is solid and protects the display nicely. However, it does give the laptop a heterogeneous look and feel with the rest of the frame being made of plastic.

One aside here, the 13 does have unique touches not found on higher end models. For example, the "i's" in the ThinkPad in both the lid and the palm-rest glow and ThinkPad logo has a really nice brushed finish to it on the lid.

Opening the laptop for servicing and upgrading is not a good experience. The bottom base is held by 10 captive screws and is incredibly fiddly to pry open. I ended up scratching off some of the paint of the bottom cover in the two times I tried opening the base. That said, upgradability is much better than what you can find on comparable ultrabooks. Both DDR4 RAM slots, the M.2 SATA SSD (no NVMe on Gen. 1 unfortunately), the Wi-Fi card, and battery can be easily replaced.

The touchpad has its share of mechanical issues too. It is a clickpad design, similar to that found on older MacBooks. Sometimes dust/debris would find its way in the gap between the base of the laptop, causing the right button to stop physically clicking. It's a simple problem to fix and all it needs is a swap with a piece of thick paper to clean the underside of the touchpad. Nevertheless, I expected a more robust design when it comes to this. At least this problem isn't exclusive to the 13, it seems to happen to the T450s as well.

Lastly, the plastic construction does have some drawbacks when it comes to scratches. Part of the lid is plastic and is much more scratched up than the aluminium part of it. After a year, the base unit also had some paint rubbing off from the edges. I would suggest buying a carrying sleeve to avoid this from happening. The silver palmrests also have taken a slightly darker shade to the rest of the laptop.

Fortunately, all the damage is only cosmetic and the laptop has held up pretty well after being jostled around campus for more than a year.

## I/O

Connectivity is a strong point for the ThinkPad 13. It's impressive to see how many ports there are on a laptop of this size! You get 3 USB-A ports running at USB 3.0 speeds, a full size HDMI port, an SD card reader in which the card goes all the way in, a headphone jack, *and* a USB-C port supporting charging and 2160p/60fps video out. There's also Lenovo's propietary OneLink+ docking solution though I haven't tried this out yet.

On the subject of the USB-C port, a minor nitpick is that it's USB 3.1 Gen1 and doesn't support Thunderbolt. I still much prefer it to the option of having a full size ethernet port as on the T460s. The USB-C port is so much more flexible.

I also discovered that all the USB ports support fast (faster?) charging. My phone charges as fast from the laptop's USB port as it does from a 5V/1.5A charger.

Wireless connectivity is serviced by the Intel 8260 Wi-Fi card, the same one used on all the top-spec 2016 ThinkPads. Speed and connection quality is good and it supports 802.11ac.

## Display

The display on my laptop is the LG 1080p IPS display with a matte coating. Even for an IPS display, the viewing angles are excellent. 13.3" and 1080p is a sweet spot for sharpness and UIs scale fine in both KDE Neon and Windows 10. Thanks to the matte coating, the screen brightness is perfectly sufficient 90% of the time when I use it. I've hardly run into any instances where I felt the need to crank the screen brightness any higher. Colour space coverage is reportedly below average for an IPS screen, but it still feels a lot better than the TFT display I was used to using on my old laptop. For coding and web-browsing, it's hard to ask for more.

## Battery Life

The ThinkPad 13 is powered by a 42 Wh battery. It has degraded slightly from when I got the laptop - initially the battery was able to hold 46 Wh of charge but now it usually holds 40-41.5 Wh when full. My frequent use case with the laptop is several Firefox tabs open with some IDE's like VS Code, Atom, or Android Studio on KDE Neon. The laptop is *very* energy efficient and power draw rarely climbs above 6W at 30% brightness after enabling TLP on KDE Neon. My old laptop used to *idle* at 17W and when people claim that Intel has gimped their CPUs since the IvyBridge era, I think they're disregarding the huge leaps in power efficiency.

In more than a year of owning it, I haven't once drained the battery. I've gotten through 9-5 days at a summer internship solely off battery power. I can't speak of how good or bad battery life is on Windows 10 as I've never used it for anything other than gaming, which brings me to my next section.

## Keyboard

Really good! For years, I used to think that the AccuType keyboard on my Lenovo G580 was unbeatable, but that changed as soon as I laid my hands on the ThinkPad 13's keyboard. The keys are perfectly spaced, have amazingly deep travel, and have great texture. I really like the layout too - PgUp/PgDn + Ctrl makes it very easy to switch tabs and Fn and Right Ctrl can be swapped in the BIOS.

It turns out that the keyboard on the 13 is *exactly* the same as the one on the T460s. I learned this by ruining the stock keyboard when doing my weekly round of sterilising all my electronic devices. AliExpress didn't have the silver 13 keyboard but the 13's FRU manual showed that the T460s keyboard (albeit black instead of silver) could be directly dropped in. After a month of waiting to get it shipped from China, it was a simple 10 minute job to replace the keyboard. Props to Lenovo for reusing FRUs and keeping the 13 so serviceable.

I'm pretty happy with the touchpad as well. It's large enough and has a very satisfying physical click to it. Gestures work well and it's supported out of the box on Linux. The TrackPoint and click buttons have become indispensable for coding. I haven't compared it to other ThinkPad's when it comes to the TrackPoint.
