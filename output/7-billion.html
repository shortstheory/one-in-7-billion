    <p>Today the world has reached a new milestone, which has compelled me to change
the very name of this blog itself. Yes, we reached the population landmark of
7,000,000,000 or seven billion according to a UN estimate. According to me
population growth is <em>not</em> a good trend and achieving it has some serious
implications. The world is already ridden with poverty, AIDS and a host of
problems with which the majority of the population can not keep up with. Sure,
we have more people and man-force. But that doesn't help the fact that unlike
population, resources do not reproduce by themselves. Providing for seven
billion odd people is more than what the earth can give.  </p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of the world's population growth.  </p>
<p>This is positive information. The world has only added one billion people in
13 years since the last milestone of six billion. More people would probably
mean higher growth rates. It's not happened in this case due to successful
campaigns from the Chinese - 400 million less births. However, even with the
current growth rate, it will not be sustainable to have more people on this
planet in a few decades.  </p>
<p>Food for thought. Comment and express your opinions.  </p>
