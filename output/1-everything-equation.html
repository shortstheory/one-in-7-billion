    <p>What's your unlucky number?  </p>
<p>"13", say some people  </p>
<p>"Nooo, 4", say the others.  </p>
<p>My unlucky number's 1. Yup.  The closest whole number to zero really sucks for
me. Cricket: Lost by 1 run. Badminton: 20-21 (no deuces). It's pretty much
everywhere. More so from a competitive exam viewpoint: NSO, IMO, IAIS, they've
all gone up in smoke because of 1 mark. But that really doesn't compare to my
worst defeat.  </p>
<p>Infosys CTY.  </p>
<p>I was pretty happy with myself till I got to know of the top six. I couldn't
believe it, so I stormed into the co-coordinator's room.  </p>
<p>"How much did I get", I asked.  </p>
<p>After fumbling a bit, she said I got 18/20. I didn't know how that could
disqualify me because everyone else got 18/20 as well.  </p>
<p>"I could've chosen you instead of anyone of the other six. But your mistake,
well, I can't pardon that."  </p>
<p>I had messed up on the easiest question in that paper: "What's 25% of 25%?". I
decided not to argue. It really hurt that I screwed up on that. Every morning
for a few months I woke up with the same question, "What good am I in anything
else, if I can't even make it to the top six in my school?".  </p>
<p>Scars don't fade easily, and this one didn't heal till a month ago.  </p>
<p>There you have it: 'The 1 = Everything' equation.</p>
